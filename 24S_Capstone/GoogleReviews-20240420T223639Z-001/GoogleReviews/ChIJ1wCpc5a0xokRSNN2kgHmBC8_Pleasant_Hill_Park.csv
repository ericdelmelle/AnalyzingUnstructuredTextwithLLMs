There are bathrooms there but they are not the cleanest so bring those wet wipes and disinfectant out. But when you got to go you got to go.

The pond is nice to check out even if you aren‚Äôt fishing. The kids like to see the fish, frogs, and turtles. Beware of the geese though, they don‚Äôt seem to have fear of you and will come at you if you are in their space.",5

There are about 6 seperate man made ponds that has small bass  some pretty big carp and Catfish. The other side is the Delaware river which has a boat ramp in the main section. You can also fish the river  from that side. The view which is basically the river attracts people to hang out and relax. This place is a staple in the Northeast some may call it Linden ave. Which is the name of the road that leads you back there. There is ball fields there also. There are firework displays during the holidays.,5

The fishing area and the water front view or some people use to go on their boats. The reason I‚Äôm giving it 4 star and not 5 is because some shady business going on with cars in the parking lot. But I mind my own business and generally feel safe. There‚Äôs a Big long slide which is fun for kids that like an extra thrill. There‚Äôs a 5+ section and a toddler slide play area. They Accomodate a swing for handicap and have baby swings Ofcourse. It also had a nice walking trail and a big field to play football , soccer , tennis , fly a kite etc.",4

It's  a great  place to hang out  with friends,family  ,and to also bring your children. They have  fishing ,a playground  for kids ,food ,drinks ,and a places to picnic. In addition  there is a boat ramp that makes  the Delaware River  readily  accessible, and ducks as well as Canada Geese.  The park was a little dirty  with cigarette butts ,litter and there are no Park Rangers, however  they do have surveillance  cameras  ,so just be mindful of your surroundings just in case . Aside for from these minor shortcomings, I would definitely recommend  visiting  Pleasant Hill Park in Philadelphia .  üòÅüëç",4

People like to bring their bikes here and do burnouts. Same for their cars. If you don't mind the noise you'll be okay. Gets less family friendly after sunset.

The playground has settings, slides, climbing rope tower, climbing play structures, and a cool worn sculpture smashing around its border that children enjoy clamboring on.  The park has a fish hatchery, catch and release fishing, girls, a small woods, the boat launch into the Delaware River, and good views of the ships in the river.  Careful climbing on the rocks on the river bank.  I like that they have allowed the edge to become more naturalized with bushes and more mature trees, and so do the ducks and geese that can now be seen there.  One of the best parks in the city.  Still, it needs a water fountain and proper restrooms by the playground.",5

Can be nice, can be trashy. It depends on the weather, the amount of actual litter and how many people are there.
It's a nice walk through the fish hatchery, look for turtles, bullfrogs in the spring. There are also three huge, white swans that reside near the boat launch.",4

Enjoyed watching the children fishing with their parents .  Often drove by but never took the time to experience it .  One suggestion : there seemed to be a lot of cigarette butts on the ground, perhaps people don't know that there is No Smoking in public parks .  The signs did state this, along with the other 'do's and don't's', but signs for this purpose only may help .  One man was about to light up when I mentioned there is No Smoking in the Park, and he replied that he was far enough away from the playground to smoke ...   .  Otherwise, it was a wonderful time, long overdue !",4
