Opened in 2013, it‚Äôs not just a haven for skateboarders but a mixed-use public space that embodies the city‚Äôs commitment to recreational and cultural activities. The park features elements reminiscent of the beloved Love Park, catering to skaters of all skill levels, while also serving as a picturesque spot for visitors to relax and enjoy the urban landscape. With its robust schedule of events, including contests and demos, Paine‚Äôs Park is a testament to Philadelphia‚Äôs vibrant community spirit and its embrace of skateboarding as a vital part of the city‚Äôs social fabric.",5

I'm not saying don't go there at night because it's definately one of the only spots to hang out, be super loud and best of all its a fairly easy to continue drinking past 2am if your 21, right? Whatever! Luv it and keep it clean.",5

Lines can be awkward given the layout, but are workable. Good place to learn the fundamentals before you hit FDR or something.  Also, it's rare that I ever see any scooter kids here.

As a beginner I've had good experiences here.  It's often pretty quiet during the day in the workweek but gets busy on weekends. Everyone is super chill and friendly, as skaters tend to be.  Don't be surprised if you see folks having beer, cigarettes, or weed.  Can be off-putting for noobies or families, but again, the people are super chill.  You're not far from some great restaurants and bars either, if you're looking for something to eat or drink after a sesh.",4

The grafitti park is next to the Schuylkill River trail and tucked behind the Art Museum. It's a good place to learn how to skateboard--there are 3 different skateboarding areas with ramps and pipes. There is an Indego bike station next to the park to make it easier to get to.,5

The half pipes are not though, there is very minimal room to get speed on the bigger half pipes and the shorter quarter pipes are barely enough to sustain speed while in transition. This park has a cool vibe I guess but it could have been so much more if Philly had hired a professional skatepark specific landscape architect. Oh yeah and no bowls so that kinda sucks.",2

It's a fun plaza with varying surfaces and lots of ledges, banks, and pads. Lots of fun stuff to manual and grind. Definitely opportunity for experienced riders to throw some bangers here, but not a ton of stuff for new skaters to learn on. No real low rails or ledges to practice on and the stairs are all decent size. One cool thing is though that there's lots of open flat area to practice flat ground or play skate without getting in people's way!",5
08/20/2019 18:10:13,DJ TOPDOG,111683465594567872789,This park looks like it was a public space that had quarter pipes with no coping added all around. It is fairly large with a pretty cool lay out. There are tons of benches and ledges with a few stair sets. It would have been a little better with a more than jut one flat bar. I went on a Saturday around 3pm and it wasn't busy at with maybe 15 other people skating.  My favorite part was the way the ground was angled. It seemed like i was always rolling down hill even when i was going up.,4

It's a fun spot but it definitely takes some time to get used to.

If you're in the area check it out, but it looks a lot better in photos.",3
