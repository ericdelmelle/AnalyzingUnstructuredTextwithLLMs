Located at Eakins Oval, right in front of the iconic Philadelphia Museum of Art, it’s a seasonal attraction that offers a unique blend of art, music, food, and entertainment. During its operation from mid-June to mid-August, The Oval becomes a hub of activity where visitors can enjoy a beer garden, diverse live performances, and interactive art installations. It’s a place where families can come together for fun-filled afternoons, and friends can gather to unwind in the evenings. With its ever-changing schedule of events, The Oval is a testament to Philadelphia’s creative spirit and community engagement."

There's live music, a beer garden, games like corn hole, Jenga, & chess. There's a children's play area, along with a food truck. There's also sweet treats available at Streat Philly, the funnel cake was just what we needed, & Mr. Softee was parked right in front of the Art Museum, too. In addition to the ferris wheel, there's also merry-go-round. This is a nice chill spot for adults & kids, too."

Restroom facilities are great. Sprayground was swt to a fine mist. Very refreshing.
Food trucks were the usual level of insanity.

A couple rows back from the fence was like reaching out and touching the team. Then KELCE put a cherry on top of it all with a speech that left us speechless. If I wasn't there in person I wouldn't believe the fire and pent up emotion he had with every word he methodically uttered, well actually hollered, towards the sea of spectators with our jaws flopping on the ground. The curse words here and there just put an explanation point to the end of an incredible season. His outfit was over the top also. Thank you to all those involved in putting together this incredible event on such short notice that countless onlookers will never forget. But the Philadelphia Police were hands down the biggest shocker as they didn't hassle anyone, they all stayed calm and seemed to enjoy the moment with the rest of us. They could have been jerks and cuffed and hauled alot of intoxicated folks off to jail but instead they let everyone savor the precious moments evolving before our eyes and only addressed a couple situations that's couldn't be overlooked, one was a medical emergency to get the stretcher in and out of the crowd which couldn't have been done any quicker or smoother than it did. The crowd  separated opening a huge path for the stretcher and responders. Hope to bring another parade there soon from any of our teams. Getting out after everything was completed was another adventure in its self. Made it out safely and slowly with an extra thick coating if mud up to the knees."

07/23/2018 13:33:40,Scott Wilkinson,105007202898103401135,2,"Maybe it's not a fair comparison but this place pales in comparison to other Philly pop-ups like Spruce St Harbor Park.  There clearly was a much lower budget avail for this one as it felt more like an afterthought than a well planned use of such nice space.

Avoiding the comparison, even on its own there just wasn't much here in terms of ambience.  You are constantly reminded that you are hanging out in a glorified painted parking lot.  There aren't enough vendors providing food (five foodtrucks were there for opening night offering meatballs, cheese curds, Asian food, popsicles and the life-saving cheese steak truck which had a 25 minute line).

I will give it another shot this summer.  The recent rain may have muddied my perspective.  But I think we will be spending more time down by the river."

Then, in front of the Art Museum, three fountains worth visiting with the keystone being the George Washington Monument in the center."

I walked around a bit and watched the musiciand on the stage on the opposite side of the oval. They were a really fun funk group with horns, bass, backup singers and a front man in leopard skin right pants and a vest. Everyone seemed into it, and the place was relatively crowded. I got a meatball sub from one of the several food trucks (Mamma's Balls) and headed back to our spot by the big screen. There were very comfortable plastic Adirondack chairs scattered about, so I brought one over to where we were sitting. The whole experience was really fun, and had a very fun family vibe to it. If you're in the area in the summer, definitely check it out and see what they have going on!"
