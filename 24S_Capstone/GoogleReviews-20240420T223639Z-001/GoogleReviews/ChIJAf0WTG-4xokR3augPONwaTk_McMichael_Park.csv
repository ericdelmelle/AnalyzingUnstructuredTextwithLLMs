He was also the first President of Philadelphia‚Äôs Fairmount Park Commission from 1867 to 1879. The park, located at 3300 Midvale Ave, offers outdoor recreation and nature preservation, maintained by the Philadelphia Parks Department. It‚Äôs a place where the community can engage with nature and enjoy open spaces. The park‚Äôs history is further enriched by the discovery of numerous Indian artifacts, indicating that it was once the location of an Indian village. McMichael Park continues to be a vital part of the city‚Äôs park system, providing a peaceful retreat for residents and visitors alike.",5

In fact, the ""jungle gym is designed like a giant spider web & very limited in that it's not very accessible to the younger ones. And, unfortunately, there is no sliding board (how do you not have a sliding board for the kids, lol).
Overall, it's a nice, clean park in itself.",4
