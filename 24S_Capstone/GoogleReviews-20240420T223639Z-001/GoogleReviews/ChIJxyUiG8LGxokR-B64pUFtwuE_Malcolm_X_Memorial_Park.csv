Named in honor of the civil rights leader Malcolm X, the park is a six-acre urban oasis around 51st Street and Pine Street, known for its summer jazz festival and vibrant atmosphere. Recently, the park faced a devastating fire that damaged its electrical system, restrooms, and a beloved mural of Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz. The community has rallied together, with plans to restore the park and its facilities, reflecting the resilience and unity of the neighborhood. This restoration effort, including a community cleanup and financial support from local representatives, underscores the park‚Äôs importance as a symbol of heritage and a focal point for community engagement.",5

I have started walking with WEWalk PHL, which is a Facebook group right here at Malcolm X Park. I enjoy it so much. I have been meeting females from all walks of life. It is great because we don't know one another at all when we first meet up, however we begin talking with one another as if we have known each other for years. WeWalkPHL is a great group, for women and men, young people and seniors alike. However we see a lot of seniors, primarily because most young people are working. We meet around 8:30 am to 9:30 am on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We always finish with a group picture in which one of the members uploads the pictures to the WeWalkPHL Facebook group, where we can all go and view them. I have saved the photos to my device and to my pages on Facebook. I look forward to walking with these ladies every week. Also there is plenty of street parking since we walk early in the morning. Have a great evening, Google Family!!",4

As we celebrated the birth of Malcolm X on Sunday, May 19, 2019 I had the pleasure of filming an interview with Black Panther Party Cubs Chairman Fred Hampton, son of Fred Hampton Sr. and Founder and General of the Official Million Woman March MWM20 ~ Universal Movements Empress Chi on my platform The elements media networks GLOBAL UNION NEWS CHANNEL: GLOBAL NEWS FROM PEOPLE IN THE FIELD!

""We are not a prison activist organization. We are a revolutionary organization."" -Chairman Fred Hampton, Jr, the son of assassinated Black Panther Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton Sr. and Comrade Mother Akua Njeri - is the founder of the Prisoners Of Conscience Committee. Chairman Fred Jr. is an active community organizer and is currently President and Chairman of the Prisoners of Conscience Committee (POCC/BPPC).

‚ÄúThe first piece of steel I felt when I was a baby wasn‚Äôt a doctor‚Äôs stethoscope,‚Äù Fred Hampton Jr. shares with ESSENCE. ‚ÄúIt was a Chicago police officer‚Äôs revolver as he pressed it against my mother‚Äôs pregnant belly.‚Äù

While Hampton Jr. was born into the fight for Black liberation, his father died from it. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois State Attorney‚Äôs Office, and the Chicago Police Department succeeded in their mission to kill Fred Hampton. A rising star in the Black Panther Party, Hampton‚Äôs charismatic leadership and calls for economic justice and revolution across racial lines made him the target of a state-sponsored assassination.

By 1969, Fred Hampton had stepped up in the Party‚Äôs leadership while Huey Newton, the Party‚Äôs co-founder, was imprisoned.  The ‚ÄòFree Huey‚Äô campaign was galvanizing activists around the globe. Martin Luther King‚Äôs assassination a year prior devastated Black Americans and helped radicalize an increasingly militant message against capitalism and racism.

It was this growing popular resentment against economic inequality ‚Äî and black leaders like King and Hampton that could effectively organize the masses to fight this inequality ‚Äî that frightened government officials at every level. And Fred Hampton was a brilliant organizer."" - BY MALAIKA JABALI

They frequently use this park to host FREE social events for those that live in the area. I live in another state and I make sure I'm present every summer so I can sit back and enjoy the FREE jazz and oldies nights the host every wk. I've also been luck enough to catch a few plays and a open Mic or two sessions...
Absolutely love this park...

I cant believe people let their young children play here with that type of activity going on 24/7. hopefully as the area gentrifies, this place will get cleaned up. I walked 100 feet into the park and counted over 140 drug vials and containers littered everywhere.  That Aside I think the dedication to Malcolm X is a neat Idea but as the history shows his Philadelphia apartment was no where near this area.",2
