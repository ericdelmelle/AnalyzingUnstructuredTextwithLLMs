The renovation and views are very awesome. I just want to bring light to all the pollution. If you walk out to the edge of the water you can see all the trash that has washed up on shore when the river is high. Really sad to see. We really need to start being mindful of our environment.      I dont recommend walking your dog out to the very end of the dirt path. I spotted needles everywhere washed up in the debris. Very sad to see.,5
