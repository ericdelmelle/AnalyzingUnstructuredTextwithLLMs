Located outside the gate of Camp Gilbert H. Johnson, part of Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the memorial serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made in the line of duty. Each year, it becomes the site of a commemorative ceremony honoring the victims of the devastating attack. The memorial not only marks a significant event in military history but also symbolizes the enduring spirit and resilience of the armed forces.",5
