08/03/2023 16:24:26,Kimberly Washington,116458756888427818922,I was born and raised and played in the part for many many years I learned how to ride my bike in the pathways of the part now I give events at the classic park today. Nice place for a lite picnic... Councilman Mark Squilla has a   Porter potty in the park for constituents to use...,5
08/01/2023 00:07:54,Sin The Black Rose,102570460033273915531,"This park is small. They have many squirrels! I find that in Philly they don't have many in the smaller parks, for whatever reason. They also seem to have a small murder of crows roosting in a tree trunk. I love Corvids.  Across the street from this park is a courtyard, a pool, and playground where they play many sports, mostly soccer it seems. Keeps the kiddos busy for summer. As the park is small, the benches are kind of limited to sit on and not in great shape. It's still a clean park where people do minimal things like small BBQs (not sure we're allowed to) play mallet ball or whatever it's called, maybe picnic, ride a bike, Rollerblade, walk around with your lover, read a book (my favorite). So enjoy a jog around and sit down to watch the stars..whatever you like. I think it's safe enough but that's my experience thus far, as someone sorta new to the area.",3

It has a dog water station, a port a pottie, a free mulch pile, and a little free library. It doesn’t get the amount of visitors that Mifflin Square gets, but perhaps that’s why I prefer this park. You can also use the bathrooms at Sacks playground next door.",5

They do offer doggy poop bags which is a godsend and helps keep the place clean. There's also a little library. Take a book. Leave a book which is apparently well used.
