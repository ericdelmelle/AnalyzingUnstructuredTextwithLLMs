The playground is beautiful. Hopefully, they fix the basketball courts which are very neglected which are around Cobbs Creek & Christian Sts."

The park's lush greenery and winding creek create a peaceful atmosphere perfect for a leisurely stroll or a picnic. The well-maintained trails are great for hiking or biking, and the scenic views make for an enjoyable outdoor experience. Plus, the park often hosts community events and activities, fostering a sense of togetherness among locals. It's a must-visit for anyone seeking a tranquil urban oasis."

A big wooded area where the parks and recreations were built along the creek that flows through. The park is awesome, the trails are great, and you can get lost in the natural scenery. Huge location too so you can always find a spot to chill, grill, play basketball, walk, hike, or whatever else floats your boat. Highly recommended."

There was a stone horse barn in front of us for the mounted Police Horses. My father threw me up on his shoulders and off we go through the park with apples and sugar cubes. In the snow.the police put up hay bales and down the hill on sleds..Summer was a water ice truck. Walks with my father along the water under the willows. Beautiful memory.

01/13/2021 16:41:15,Casey ROSS,108431800912807448788,5,"Cobbs Creek Park essentially consists of three different things: an asphalt recreational trail along Cobbs Creek Parkway between Race Street and Woodland Avenue; a gravel trail along the Creek's eastern edge between Spruce Street and Baltimore Avenue, and completely un-improved, wild woodlands full of deer paths, unofficial man-made trails, and secret bits of old infrastructure.

The asphalt trail, part of the East Coast Greenway, provides easy access to facilities such as basketball courts, tennis courts, playgrounds, and picnic areas. It also connects to the Laura Sims Skate Rink and the Cobbs Creek recreation Center between Spruce and Walnut Streets, and the Cobbs Creek Environmental Center at Catharine Street. Many of these are regularly used by the community, and on a nice day you'll see lots of people out and about grilling, playing sports, walking their dogs, exercising, and walking.

The gravel trail is a hilly, unpaved path the runs along the Creek's edge. It starts just north of Spruce Street but is most easily-accessible from the Southwest corner of Spruce Street and Cobbs Creek Parkway. The trail is within the Creek's flood plain so after a big storm it can get pretty messed up, but it is maintained and things like fallen trees are always eventually cleared. It's more isolated than the paved asphalt trail and there is no lighting so at night it's completely dark, but it provides a lovely place to take a walk through the woods. It's usually used by people walking or riding bikes, but you also have to look out for people on illegal dirt bikes and ATVs sometimes.

Most of Cobbs Creek Park is comprised of unimproved woodlands. The only capital improvements the City has ever made to Cobbs Creek Park were installed in the 1930s, when WPA funds were used to create the original Cobbs Creek Recreational Trail. Many White Tailed Deer live in these woods and they've created a network of deer paths that criss-cross the creek from the north end of the park to its southern tip. Humans use these deer paths as unofficial trails, and have created some of their own trails that are maintained mostly through use and probably the care of one or two individuals who clear and mark them.

The unofficial trails are all over the place. Some are used my more people than others, and many of them are usually deserted. There are several locations obviously used as ""secret places"" with manmade lean-tos and clubhouses stashed along the creek here and there, as well as some sparsely-occupied homeless encampments. Wandering through the remote areas of the woods can feel uneasy and unsafe at times, but provides for fun hiking and exploring opportunities if you're up for it."

05/05/2019 11:18:26,Denise,116024134183736702159,5,I love this park sooo much. I grew up going to this park. It's literally across the street from my grandma's home. It's awesome and it's always crowded during the warm months. Even though it's always noisy we don't mind. It's just fun to see different people having a good time. There's always a party or a barbecue going on.  Some people don't know but if you walk further back in the park towards Yeadon there is a stream of water. It's very relaxing.

... AND THE DEER seem to come through almost every day. They usually show in pairs but sometimes there'll be 5 or more. Doe and fawn. I've never seen  a buck near the basketball courts, tennis courts or the kiddie playground, though. They visit in early afternoon mostly. They like eating the east-facing foliage, apparently.
The park needs a little more work and care to really achieve its best look. As the people who care join forces, I believe others will demand the needed attention be given. I feel very optimistic about its future appeal, even while the site desperately needs real restrooms and water fountains for the joggers, tennis and ball players. Maybe a dog park would be nice!
It's about to go down! I mean, up! I mean, ummm ... It's gonna be GREAT-ER!"
