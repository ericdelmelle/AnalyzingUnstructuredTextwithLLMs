The photo is of a grove of cherry trees circling a former American Legion brick monument. The park is a 3-block flat expanse of grass on a hill with a view of the Septa line (it's close to Tacony station). There were a few park benches but no other park amentities except trees and grass. This park is close to the Tacony bridge into NJ  but no river view from it. Our dog enjoyed the grassy areas."
