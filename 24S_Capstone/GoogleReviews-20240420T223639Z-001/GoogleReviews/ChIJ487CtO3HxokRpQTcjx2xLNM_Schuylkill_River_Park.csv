This doesn't spoil the big and small dog parks and basketball courts that get full court games and sometimes 2 simultaneously.,4

05/25/2021 18:50:48,Sarah Giangiobbe,106882117803271303520,"This review is specific to the dog park! We’ve visited a few dog parks throughout the city and this is one of our favorites. There is a small and big dog section, water for the pups, and poop bags in case you run out. The big dog section has plenty of space to run and both are turf so you don’t have to worry about dirt as much. I will mention the the big dog section gets a large puddle if it rains which can be frustrating if you have a pup who loves water. Along with that there is an area where the wall is short enough for pups to jump over and there is usually mud behind it. Overall a great place to take your pup! Bonus: rowhome coffee is right around the corner, stop by afterwards for great coffee and even better philly pretzel breakfast sandwiches, it makes the perfect weekend morning!",4

Beautiful location right off the river with playgrounds, tennis courts, and a top notch dog park! The doggie area has two fenced in portions - one for big dogs (over 25lbs), and one for little dogs to meet, play, and enjoy!

Highly recommend to anyone looking for a day in the park (especially for dog walkers!)",5

01/04/2020 08:29:40,Ellie Vegan Philly -,104695241941942306694,"Love this place. Best dog park in Center City. It’s not huge but there is always enough room even when it’s packed with dogs. It does have separate enclosures for small dogs and big dogs which is super nice- the big dog park has more space as well and I’ve never seen space be a problem there.

For the most part the doggie parents here are nice too. I’ve met really nice people there.

I think it helps that people can decide what side is best for their dogs.

People share the toys they bring and are not uptight about it when other dogs play with their dog’s toys. So, if you bring a toy make sure you don’t mind other dogs playing with it.

Depending on when you go sometimes there is on street parking in the neighborhood. If there’s any other parking associated with the park I am unaware of it.

It’s open 24/7 and has small stadium style lighting and I’ve seen other people their with their dogs as late as midnight.

There is also seating for the parents and water for the dogs. The park is made of AstroTurf which is cool too because my dog gets less muddy here. Although, she still may get dirty it’s not as bad as other parks. The parents also all clean up after their dogs and it’s very clean.

Highly recommended if your dog loves playing with other dogs.

Just know that most dogs that come here like to wrestle, all in good fun. So, if you’re dog isn’t into that sort of off leash play than this is not be the park for you.

But, if your dog likes to rip around with other dogs in good supervised fun, then place is perfect!",5

Both Laid back and festive atmosphere. Of course, it's one of the featured parks in the city, so it's well taken care of haha.

Dogs of all sizes, quirks and characters come here and like to romp around and socialize with others of their kind or the human beings. It is a good sized, double gated fenced in play area complete with a few benches to sit on, minor shrubbery area for dogs to sniff, and small watering station and mini pool for our four legged friends to cool off a bit.

11/14/2018 17:02:27,Acr,114063163808322080589,Not a bad dog park overall. I personally think that the artificial grass is kind of gross when it hasn't rained in a few days and you can clearly see/smell poop and pee. Other than that it's a great place to take your dog to let them get rid of some energy.,3

10/28/2018 18:46:09,Mark Henninger,105814257563475985711,"Certainly a beautiful park that is a great starting point for a ride down the Schuylkill River Trail. as a dog park here, there is a community garden here, there's a large grassy field here, and there's also a community center that has sports facilities. This includes basketball courts that are always in use.

The scene here is always friendly, and not only is this a great spot for people watching but it is also a great one for dog watching because this is the dog park where the Rittenhouse Crowd goes.

if you cross the tracks onto the trail and take a left, you'll enjoy a ride down the boardwalk. If you take a right on the trail, you can follow that to the art museum and enjoy fantastic views of the downtown bridges on the way.

parking may be a little bit tough in this neighborhood, but perhaps you should find a way to walk or bicycle here instead.",5

The dog park is almost an event, not only for people who have dogs, but there are a lot of people who just like to stand out and watch the dogs in the park. There are bikers and runners and people strolling around. You could actually ride your bike 21 miles up to Valley Forge and back. What a great discovery for someone who was visiting Philadelphia on several occasions. Of note, there are number of restrooms along the way, which is pretty hard to find in the city of Philadelphia unless you're a customer at a restaurant or bar. And there are a couple of small restaurants along the way, that you could stop and enjoy a drink or small bite as you stroll around, and of course it leads you up to the Philadelphia Museum of Art ... but for that you'll need a couple of days to truly enjoy.",5

This can lead to issues but most owners are responsible in separating and removing their dogs when issues happen. This isn't always the case, so just be weary about what your and other dogs are doing. There are trash cans available and usually a lot of balls around.
We go a couple times a month. It was very good when we were socializing our puppy.",5

The surface is astroturf so it's not as messy unless they run into the back side. Plenty of space to run around in the small and large side.

If you don't live in the area and have to drive there, then parking can be a hassle, especially on the weekdays. Nice that Rival Brothers are close by, so if you want to grab a coffee for the park you can.",5

07/25/2016 10:41:56,Matt Newlin,116515115585437657922,"I use it for the dog park.  Fully enclosed dog run.  It's a nice size and enough to get my guys running and worn out.  There is a two gate entry to the run to reduce the chance of runaways if someone doesn't close or latch the gate fast enough.  There is a water faucet with built in bowls for the pooches as well as a hose if you need to spray off or clean up anything.  I believe the dog run ""closes"" at 10pm.  There is okay lighting in the evening and usually a few other owners out.

Most of the regulars are nice and range from friendly and chatty to quietly pleasant.  There have been a few owners who have aggressive dogs and they don't seem to care.  It has been rare but it does happen.

Final note:  There is a large, open grassy spot in front of the actual run.  A number of owners like to let their dogs off leash in this area.  While I understand the want to let the dogs ""run free"", there are bikes, families, loud trains and other city noises/hazards that are around.  I don't think its wise to let your dog off leash and I have seen people tickets for doing so.",4
