A redeeming feature thought is its lovely background setting. Located on a lush green grassy field with beautiful mature trees and meandering little bench lined paths. A natural environmentally precious nook within the greater confines of the city !

There is not a lot here for kids to play on (though there is enough) so I would suggest the park around the corner on Conshohocken that has more stuff but this location is great for just hanging out or for playing with your dog (note that it isn't a dog park though).
