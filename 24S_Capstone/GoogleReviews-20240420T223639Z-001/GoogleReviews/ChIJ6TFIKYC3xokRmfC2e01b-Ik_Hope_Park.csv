As soon as he overdosed somebody was waiting with bolt cutters to cut his  Bike off of the bench that he was sitting on and steal his cannondale bike and then after 2 minutes they realized he was dead I seen a lady pull out her phone she was obviously calling 911  I myself called 911 no 1 ever came! That boy was someone's son someone's brother someone's cousin someone's uncle He was somebody's  Someone and he was treated like discarded trash....I've never Experienced anything like that in my life but that is what hope park it's like!children were walking over his dead body for an hour..... Sad.....,1

Hell Cardi B and Nicki Minaj were driving around in there Maybach with there Polo,Gucci and Fendi gear on. I wanted to stick around because Target was sponsoring a Double feature in the park at night first it was Gladiator than Star Wars. But its scary because all of the Cobras around there. Only thing missing around there was a Wawa. But i doubt they will open one in the midst of all that danger . Maybe a New Time will come and we will all go there for Halloween i just hope nobody has Nightmares. If your on the other side of town remember you can always take an Uber to Hope Park so you can be sure and make it there for Showtime its always Supreme. Next month I heard they're playing Godzilla and that new movie starring Chucky and Ric Flair called Blue Magic . they have special seating for the Handicap you can get tickets on Google. Or at your local Lukoil gas station. Just dont exit the gas station through the back door or you'll set off the alarm. You dont wanna Shine like that .
