06/29/2019 21:40:29,Felicia Hinton,103485857409815194216,4,The playground is great. But they need to keep the grass cut & make sure that the community center is open for the ppl that have events out there. It's a great park but needs alot of TLC for sure. I will come back but things need to be done better. Today there was no place for anyone to go to the bathroom & there was kids out there. Nobody wants to have to take their child to the bar across the street or pee in the public. It's not right all this because they didn't open up the community center.
06/26/2019 17:05:26,M. L.,111952043156561643645,1,"Two weeks before our event, I was notified that the bathrooms are not working and Denise (with Chalmers) recommended to order a PortaPot. I already paid in full including the deposit to use the pavilion and bathroom facilities.  I reached to Denise three days before the event and the bathroom is still not fixed.  I was NOT offered a partial refund, I was NOT offered a discount‚Ä¶they did NOT offer to rent the PortaPot nor will they pay for it.  BUT they quickly cashed my check with no problem!  This is by far the most trifflin, unprofessional , ghetto experience. HIGH WAY ROBBERY FOR  NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY PARK!"
