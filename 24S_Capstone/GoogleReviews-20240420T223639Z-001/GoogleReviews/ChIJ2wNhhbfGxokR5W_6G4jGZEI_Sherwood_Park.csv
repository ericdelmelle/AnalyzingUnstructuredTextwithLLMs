I talked to a lawyer (Harvey yanks) and do you know he told me the city ain't at fault even though they're responsible for the maintenance.... A lady told me afterwards that that sliding board been like that... So how much maintenance is the city of Philadelphia actually doing? The lawyer even told me that the city came up with laws to protect themselves from wrong doing (not maintaining the playground area).... Omg I wish it was one of their kids, to hell with everybody in city hall... Play at this park at your own risk...",1
