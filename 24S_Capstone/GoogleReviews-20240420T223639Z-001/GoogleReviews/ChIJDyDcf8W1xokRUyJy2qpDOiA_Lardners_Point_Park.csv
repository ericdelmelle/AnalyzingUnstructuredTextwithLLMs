Located at the base of the Tacony Palmyra Bridge, the park features a paved area with benches and a gravel trail that connects to the East Coast Greenway. The highlight is the fishing pier that extends into the Delaware River, providing stunning views and a haven for anglers. It‚Äôs a perfect spot for a leisurely stroll, bike ride, or simply enjoying the waterfront ambiance. Lardner‚Äôs Point Park is a testament to the city‚Äôs commitment to creating accessible green spaces for recreation and relaxation.",5

It's a very relaxing place to walk, run/jog, bike, and fish. Native plants and flowers line the path. Clean up is a lot better in regards to the illegal dumping. Deducted one star because the restrooms are still closed, you have to use Porta potties or outhouse like structures.",2
