Bella Vista neighborhood of South Philly. The Park hosts free summer concerts and annual seasonal celebrations with holiday lights. There is a gated area with bikes and outdoor toys for children to enjoy at the park. Their Free Little Library is always full of books for all ages to take and read. There are 2 small outdoor tables plus several park benches. There's a Friends group that takes care of the garden areas, and volunteers are welcome to help with park maintenance on Love Your Park days."

We found our park, alas, closed up, oh dear!
Construction fences blocking cheer,
On a day so bright, we longed to be near,
Nature's embrace, but had to steer clear.

Disappointment hung in the sunny air,
A day made for picnics, quite the affair.
Yet hope blooms in hearts that care,
Wishing the city's plans will spare
Beauty and space for all to share."

The benches are arranged in a way that larger groups of 4-8  can sit together at one end, and groups of one and two can sit fairly separate at the other. Particular spots go from shade to sun depending on the time of day. One neutral thing - its a very kid friendly park, with a mobile toy center at one end. So sometimes the quiet shady part is filled with little kids being kids."
