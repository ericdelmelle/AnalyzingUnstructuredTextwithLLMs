This course has three sets of nine holes - the final requiring more than the others for competitive scoring. Most baskets are accessible from the tee, and even more are clearly visible.

There is a vendor who sells course-affiliated gear on the weekends. Proceeds go to maintaining and improving the course, so pick up a disc and make this gem even finer.",5
