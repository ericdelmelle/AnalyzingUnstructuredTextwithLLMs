In decent weather, you can enjoy street muscians, performers, speakers and artists.There are seasonal art shows, concerts, and a farmer's market regularly. I bring my out-of-town visitors for a stroll here, because it is a quintessential Philly experience. It's a historic park with 8 major sculptures that was one of William Penn's 5 original public squares for Philadelphia. The park is free and welcomes all, from the homeless to the well-to-do neighborhood residents cutting through.The park is so well-used by people and dogs that they have to rope off grassy sections in phases, so the ground and plants can recover. Note that there are no public restrooms, playground or water fountains here.",5

The guy who is singing with his speaker set up for money/attention/followers and anyone else who plays loudly and sings, I really think it needs to stop. The guy who plays flute, the guy who plays keyboard, the small jazz ensemble...they're all reasonable and probably acceptable. They fit with the tone of the park by being calm and, most importantly, are low-volume. You can walk 50 feet and not hear them. (Though, if I had to choose all or none, I'd choose none.)

This park is an oasis in a loud, hectic city and the amplified music like that is equivalent to someone blasting their phone or bluetooth speaker in the park or on a public bus. It's too much and ruins the whole point of going to relax, have quiet, enjoy the sounds of birds/nature, hear the person you're talking to, etc.

Do that elsewhere.

While there may be others I haven't seen, I've seen and heard this guy a lot. He goes until 9-10pm and bragged about singing there for the past 6 hours. I've sat waiting and waiting for him to wrap it up or I end up leaving. This is not a commentary on his abilities, motivation, etc. They are irrelevant. It's just not fair to everyone who wants to go there and have some relative peace and quiet around some trees and whatnot. No one should have that forced on them. We've already got songs forced on us in nearly every business we enter. Now, the only decent park in Center City has forced music, too? Please run your busking and promote your social media elsewhere. You'll get way more foot traffic (eyes/ears/donations) in other places like a random intersection. I don't go there for a concert. I go there to relax, for peace and tranquility.

A great and historical spot created in 1682-1683. One of 5 squares originally conceived/designated by William Penn himself. It has long served as a place to get away to a bit of nature in the midst of city life. It is kept clean, has very nice trees and tree cover in the hotter months, beautiful flowering plants, and plenty of birds and squirrels. It's a great place to feed birds or just relax and all new benches were recently installed. Occasionally, there are art sales and musicians performing.",5

During my recent visit, I was captivated by the park's natural beauty, vibrant atmosphere, and the historical significance that adds an extra layer of charm to this iconic destination.

One of the it's most remarkable aspects is its storied past. Named after David Rittenhouse, a renowned astronomer and Philadelphia native, the park has witnessed significant historical events over the years. It was one of the original five squares laid out by William Penn in his plan for the city, making it an integral part of Philadelphia's heritage.

Walking through the park, I couldn't help but appreciate the preservation of its historical features. The original layout, with walkways radiating from the central plaza, provides a glimpse into the park's early design. The wrought-iron fencing, dating back to the late 1800s, speaks to the craftsmanship of a bygone era.

Surrounded by architectural gems and a bustling neighborhood, Rittenhouse Square seamlessly blends the old and the new. The nearby historic brownstones and contemporary high-rises create a captivating contrast, showcasing the city's evolution while maintaining a sense of harmony with the park's ambiance.",5

Este parque urbano es un oasis  para los amantes de las caminatas en la naturaleza, los admiradores de la arquitectura y los interesados en la historia. El parque tiene una superficie de 1,5 hectáreas y se encuentra en el barrio de Rittenhouse Square, en Filadelfia, Pensilvania. Cuenta con un ambiente animado y relajado, y es visitado por locales y turistas de todas partes del mundo.

Lo primero que llama la atención del parque es su belleza natural. El césped está perfectamente cuidado y hay una gran variedad de árboles y plantas que ofrecen sombra y refrescan el ambiente. Además, hay pequeñas fuentes y estanques que le dan un toque especial al paisaje.

Otro aspecto importante de Rittenhouse Square es su arquitectura. Alrededor del parque se encuentran hermosos edificios históricos de estilo neoclásico y victoriano que le dan un aire elegante y sofisticado al lugar.

Recently, I've walked through the square after dark, a few hours past rush hour, when it has been much less populated. I was very much on guard and aware of my surroundings due to all of the violence and robberies our city has been experiencing. There was then, as there usually is, a police officer in his vehicle at the very entrance to the park, at 18th & Walnut. I was slightly optimistic about that and it did help me to feel a bit safer as I walked thru to emerge on the other side at 19th & Locust streets. After many years (at least 27) of walking thru the Square on my way to and from work, taking my lunch & eating there, meeting friends & hanging out, and even taking my 2 boys (when they were pre-school age) in the afternoons to play, I still LOVE Rittenhouse Square.

A lot is going on at Rittenhouse—not just because it's a public park, but because it's got so many things to do! You can grab some fresh produce from one of the vendors, or pick up some fashionable stuff from the boutique vendors. There are also plenty of places to grab a bite🍔, whether you're looking for something quick or fancy.

And if you're feeling like being social, there are plenty of people around who want to talk—but if you'd rather keep to yourself, that's fine too!

It's got a lovely historical feel to it, as well as being right in the center of town and easily accessible by foot. You can walk up to Independence Mall on one side and Skyukell River on another side. There's even a nice walking path next to the river if you're interested in taking a stroll with friends or family members!",5

The square is bubbling with a colorful and diverse group of visitors. They have farmers market, fine art shows and I'm sure several other locally themed events. I've seen small yoga and fitness groups there, and enjoyed local street artists, fine artists, and even a Michael Jackson impersonator who was quite impressive. It is quite a leisurely experience. The square is ideal whether you are alone, with a partner, group, family with children or just dog walking. It is surrounded my trendy shops, and restaurants and is neatly maintained and inviting. I enjoy going here. And highly recommend it to both locals and tourists.",5

The park itself is a great place to sit and relax, or have a picnic, and walk around the park.

There are great restaurants and shopping nearby.
There are many tourist attractions within walking distance such as city hall, Mutter museum, Reading terminal etc besides the shopping and restaurants already mentioned. The variety of restaurants is excellent.

You can walk up to Independence mall on one side and to the Skyukell River on the other side. There is a nice walking path next to the river.
It can be a great walking tour with a relaxing picnic lunch inside the Rittenhouse park.
Definitely this is fully worth visiting.",5

As we walked through the streets of Philly in the middle there is this beautiful Park call Rittenhouse Square. If you ever get a chance to go to Philadelphia Pennsylvania this is worthwhile! This park is very beautiful very tranquil just sit and relax and observe. I also had the privilege I was listening to a gentleman with the guitar play me some great music.

Parking is a challenge and make sure you park on the block and use the parking machine on the same block that you park since this will consider the ZONE. If you use machine on another block of where your car is located you will need the ZONE number to enter on that machine. The parking authority really needs to make things easier not more complicated for people to pay for meter parking. It is difficult enough to find parking with all the construction, side streets are closed off for extra seating for restaurants and blocked off for whatever reason.",5

Plenty of room on the grassy areas for your dog or a picnic, the amount of benches are numerous and well spaced. They had security before covid hit inside the booth within the middle that would offer dog treats for donations which is beautiful. At the moment it's not open or available, and the fountain is drained and unused as well. The park is pretty big which is nice, it also has a few art installations or statues around to look at.

This is one of the most exclusive areas to live in the city of Brotherly Love .I'm born and raised in South Philadelphia but have been living in this area on 17th and Walnut for The last 5 years. The park does an amazing job at keeping the event schedule busy throughout the summer with plenty of arts and crafts as well as good organic farmers markets and all other kinds of concerts and festivities. There is always something going on at Rittenhouse park and if I had my choice there would be no other place I would live in the city but the Rittenhouse area!!!,5

Rittenhouse Sq is part of Wm Penn's original layout for ""squares"" public parks in what was the first map of Philadelphia. Original boundaries were from the Delaware to the Schuylkill River, and Vine St to the north and and Lombard to the south. The other four squares are Logan, Franklin and Washington, with Centre (sic) Sq the site of City Hall, the largest municipal building in the country. Sukkot is the Jewish fall holiday immediately after Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur.  The sukkah  which many people eat and sleep in for 8 days, recalls the ""booths"" that the Israelites dwelled following their escape from Egypt. It's also a harvest holiday and one on which the Pilgrims based Thanksgiving.",5

It's a wonderful respite from the noisy city surrounding it. Bordered to the northeast by Walnut and 18th st, the park extends roughly one and a half city blocks in length and width. A beautiful bucolic setting for a picnic lunch on the grass, or on one of the many benches. My favorite of the four squares.",5

If you think it you can just have some peace and sit on the bench think again more than likely someone walked by with their dog and the dog will be extremely close. Or if you carry your own dog to the park be concerned that there might be another dog that it will start having a barking match with. I wish it was a park the way it used to be. Just a regular old park where you can sit and be relaxed with your kids. Now it's over crowded and like I said full of dogs. It's not a dog park. But it sure looks like one.,3

Plenty of benches to sit in under either the sun or the shade.  Grass is kept cut all the time and great for laying down on and napping or reading or just hanging out.

This use to be a really nice park to sit in. Not anymore! This park smells like dog urine. People walking their dogs let their dogs relieve themselves on the grass. So don't lay on the grass. I just don't believe people understand what it means to ""curb your dog"" and it doesn't seem to be enforced in this park. They need to put up NO DOGS ON THE GRASS SIGNS or designate a section to dogs only, but dogs definitely shouldn't be relieving themselves in random places...eww. That's not sanitary and just plain disgusting.",1

Great for people watching, also have spotted a falcon or hawk before, Saturday mornings they have their farmers market and Sunsets bathroom dancing when the weather is nice. Very convenient to the area shops and restaurants and beautiful especially during the fall. They also have art shows about 3 times a year.",5

10/22/2018 16:38:50,Meow Blanks,111467622434378461848,"Rittenhouse square, was my favorite place about 7 or 8 years ago. In the day time, there was a culture of good herbs and camaraderie. Night was always quiet and it seemed safe. In recent times it has been prone to bigotry, and, it is not a good place to be anymore with people treating the poor the way slaves were treated in the Americas in the 17 and 18 hundreds. Even though there aren't any whips the injustice here is a lewd, silent, killer.
I used to love this place, but, now I only go there because it in spite of everything it's associates (so called friends of) have done, Rittenhouse is still the safest spot in the ill city of Philadelphia",3

If you're a passive dog watcher, then you're in the right spot or want to get active and pet a cute dog, of course with the owner's permission you can try that too. If you want to get some reading done, then the many comfortable benches will help you accomplish that, there's incredible shady spots on a warm sunny day too.

The grass is conducive for a picnic blanket and groups.

Does get busy on warm sunny days and that's when the trash bins overfloweth.

Dogs, people, babies, reading, music, napping - I could tag all these.",5

I enjoy hitting up the local restaurants and getting food to go and eating in the park. Another gem is that it is close to a Barnes & Noble, so I like to go to Barnes and Noble and add to my book collection and then read at the park. Often times farmers markets are held here and vendors sell food, plants, handmade soaps, and tons of other items. I like this because I enjoy supporting small businesses.",5

Great for people watching, date night, gauging the pulse of the city. Or for your next martial arts class, yoga sesh, smoke sesh, photo shoot, wedding, street performance, farmer's market, naked bike ride, chess match, birdwatching, mid-errand lunch, rando conversation, dog playground, and all that weird, chill stuff humans sometimes have the time and pleasure to do.

Not really that big in size, if I will recall Central Park in New York City. This park can definitely be seen as among the best looking parks in Philadelphia. I have been there almost all seasons, except on winter. But it is generally quiet even if you see many people around. This is true even during the last time I went there with a friend on a weekday and where many paintings and other artworks were on display and for sale to the curious public. It still didn't look and feel crowded.",4

You can catch a farmers market here on the weekends and there are various events throughout the year like the Fine Arts Show in September.  It's also a very dog friendly park.  I gave it a 4 star because there are a lot of mice (not that big of a deal) and the homeless like to sleep and loiter here unlike at Independence Park which is policed much better.,4

I'm am for the legalization of recreational marijuana for multiple reasons, but I don't believe you should be able to smoke weed in a park. The whole park smells like weed. Not appropriate at all. Parks are meant for people in a polluted city as disgusting as Philadelphia to be with beautiful green nature and breath in any extra oxygen the leaves give off. Unfortunately, you're breathing in the carbon from burning marijuana and blunt wraps. The aesthetics of this park are amazing. That deserves 5 stars. Philadelphia has decriminalized marijuana for possession up to I believe an ounce. I'm ok with that, but it should be against the law still to smoke in parks where there are young children, pets, and other people trying to enjoy the greenery in this concrete pollution filled city.",3
