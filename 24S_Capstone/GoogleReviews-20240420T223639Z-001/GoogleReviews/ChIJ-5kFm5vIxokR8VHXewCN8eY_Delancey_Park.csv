It is nicely shaded by trees in the summer heat, and there are areas for picnicking with picnic tables along one side.  The climbing structure is perhaps small compared with Seger Park or Starr Garden, but full of activities like slides, monkey bars, suspension bridge and clubhouses.

Traffic is light on the cobblestoned residential streets that bracket the playground, but there are no gates to keep your little ones inside the park, so you'll need to keep an eye out that they don't wander away.  Every so often, there is some kind of fun fair or kid-friendly event that is used to raise money for the park.  There are flyers posted for schedules at the park, and on their website.

My kids love this park, and I think so will yours!",5
