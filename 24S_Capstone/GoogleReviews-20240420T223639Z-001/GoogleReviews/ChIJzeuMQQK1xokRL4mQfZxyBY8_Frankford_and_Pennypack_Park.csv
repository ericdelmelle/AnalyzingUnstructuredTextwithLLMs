Spanning over 1,600 acres, the park is named after the Lenni Lenape word for ‚Äúslow-moving water,‚Äù reflecting the tranquil flow of Pennypack Creek that meanders through the park. Established in 1905, it features a diverse landscape of woodlands, meadows, and wetlands, providing a habitat for a variety of wildlife. Visitors can enjoy miles of trails for hiking, biking, and horseback riding, including paths that lead to historic bridges like the Frankford Avenue Bridge, the oldest surviving roadway bridge in the United States. With its rich history and natural beauty, Pennypack Park is a beloved destination for outdoor enthusiasts and history buffs alike."

The trails runs mostly along the Pennypack Creek, which can cause flooding after heavy rains. And there are a lot of parking lots along the trail. Many more f them have picnic areas. Some have pavilions. They are also good places to go for water fun during summer."

Unfortunately, on weekends and holidays people have been partying by the creek and leaving a huge amount of rubbish. Little by little, what was beautiful has become a real and sad scene! I would like to ask the community for help in making reports to capable authorities. Let‚Äôs take care of nature for us and next generation."

It‚Äôs a shame that the signs get vandalized on occasion but that‚Äôs city life I suppose. We love the creek and my dog who is no longer with us used to love playing catch in the water. The 2 main trails of of Rhawn Street entrance are great! We alternate walking between the 2.
