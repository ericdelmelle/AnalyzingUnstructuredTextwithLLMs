But the real fun of up in the woods. Tread carefully. There are some dirt jumps up there, and some parties at the right time, plus a bunch of things I won't tell you about - they deserve their privacy 'til you find them yourself."
06/16/2019 22:06:21,Damian VanHart,117068604696442420732,5,Beautiful section of the Fairmount Park system. Small inset waterfall that leading to a pond. Stone steps (full of old graffiti) lead up to winding paths. Several rock formations and settings are found in rhe woods. Everything was very nice meshed with the forest. Picnic with awesome people under the shade of trees.

They also have weddings here occasionally, but most of the time it's just a great park to hang out in.  The pathways on the north side of the park lead up into an elevated area which used to have some BMX bike jumps, and usually has some homeless folks who set up camp here, but I've never had any issues with anyone or felt unsafe.  If you follow some of the paths toward the river, there's a really nice view over Kelly drive and the waterfront."

10/24/2018 14:22:28,steven xavier solipse,111930114774346183986,5,"One of the distinct pockets of Fairmount Park. A nice hangout spot for groups of friends, either on the grass lawn below or along the trails in the upper wooded section. You can sit on top of the Kelly Drive rock tunnel overlooking the river.

In the warmer months on the weekends there are often daytime dance parties under the trees."

Upon entering you can barely tell you're in a city anymore, and suddenly feel like you're in the ruins of a civilization lost. Take some time to wander around and explore as there's many interesting things to observe."
