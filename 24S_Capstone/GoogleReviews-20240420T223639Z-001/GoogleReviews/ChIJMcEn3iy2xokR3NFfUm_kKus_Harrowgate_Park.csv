Due to city disinvestment it has suffered. Many city residents struggle with addiction and homelessness, so risk of needles and human waste is real. Some neighbors are so used to being crapped on by the city that they don't clean up after their pets. But neighbors love this park and care for it and each other and it shows.

Don't turn your kids or dog loose without looking around a bit first. But after you've cleared it, enjoy the poetry, art, trees, and playground. Say hi to friends and neighbors- those with houses and those without.

I love Harrowgate Park.",5
