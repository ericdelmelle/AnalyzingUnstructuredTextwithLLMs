I can say this spot, the rudest spot I have visited. Rudeness is actually an understatement. The guy cashier stated I was crazy and delusional because the order he made was not to my liking, I told him I never had this item prepared as such (it was just nasty not good). So, we asked him to remake it, he said no that that's how they just make it, I stated I'll like to return for a refund. He stated I could not get one because 1 I ordered it and 2 he did not know how to do a refund. I asked for the manager he stated the owner wasn't there that I had to wait for the owner. I inquired did he step away how long will the manager return he stated he didn't know and if I wanted a refund that's the only way I could receive one. This guy was rude to another group of customers I was told. I would not recommend any one to this location especially when you come to enjoy the outside and have  nasty cashier employee that need a class in customer service."
