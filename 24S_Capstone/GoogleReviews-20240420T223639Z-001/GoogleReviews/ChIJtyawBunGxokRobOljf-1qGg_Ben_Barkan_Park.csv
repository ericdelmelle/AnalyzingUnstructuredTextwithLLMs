03/29/2024 15:24:24,Anwar Md Hossain,102007699294378549343,5,"Ben Barkan Park is a quaint and cherished green space located at 50th and Spruce streets in the heart of West Philadelphia. Established in 1971, the park honors the legacy of Ben Barkan, a local advocate for equality and the founder of the Garden Court Community Association. Known for its lush grass and mature trees, the park provides a serene oasis for residents and visitors alike. It‚Äôs not just a place to relax and enjoy nature; it‚Äôs also a venue for various community events that bring together people from all walks of life. As a testament to Barkan‚Äôs commitment to community and justice, the park continues to be a symbol of unity and a source of neighborhood pride."

There's a little playground for smaller kids, and if you're just there to hang out there's enough benches spread out from each other for comfort. Be careful after it rains or snows though, the ground gets very soft and muddy so it's a slip hazard."

In the mornings, it's mostly families and day area. Most of the day area who visit are very respectful of other kids--and often remind them to watch out for the ""babies.""

Plenty of adults use the park too. All of my friends have at least one story of people drinking or smoking pot near the playground. So as with any city park, just be aware of what's going on."

Families visiting the playground are always very friendly, and it's so much quieter than Malcolm X Park. There are sometimes people smoking weed, like at most city parks, but they do clear out away from the playground when kids show up."
