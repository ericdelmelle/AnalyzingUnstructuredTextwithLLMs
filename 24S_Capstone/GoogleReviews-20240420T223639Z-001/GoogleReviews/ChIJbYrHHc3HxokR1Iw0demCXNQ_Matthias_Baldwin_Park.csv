I love this park, it is only a few blocks from where I work and it offers a touch of nature. There are benches to relax on, a path that goes around the park and separated off into little paths to the the streets, and plenty of plants, flowers, and rock structures to gaze upon. The area is clean, and people mind themselves as they enjoy the area.
I offer the view from one of the installed benches in my photograph.",5
