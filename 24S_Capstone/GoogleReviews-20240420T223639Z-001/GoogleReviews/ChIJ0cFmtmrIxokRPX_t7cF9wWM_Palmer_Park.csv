They have Saturday clean ups where they always need extra hands esp in Fall/Spring to keep it tidy but they provide tools, tunes and snacks usually donuts. We're very lucky to have this park in our neighborhood and so thankful for the dedicated volunteers that maintain it",5

It means a lot to just stroll in and relax on a bench in this green area and become quietly absorbed in a book. The sight and presence of trees is so profoundly  comforting and may even stimulate genetic subliminal memories of forests and clean air  from a distant utopian past. Modern civilized living conditions have sadly created concrete jungles and a dulling of interactions with the natural world around us.",3

The park has trees, some flowers, but there's no playground or bathroom. Finding parking nearby is a challenge.",4

We live a few blocks away but make a point of cutting through this Park on various walking routes we take. The Park is small, but packed with trees and benches. During the weekends especially you will find people sitting around drinking their coffee and eating bagels from Philly Bagel just across the street. Come join us!",5
