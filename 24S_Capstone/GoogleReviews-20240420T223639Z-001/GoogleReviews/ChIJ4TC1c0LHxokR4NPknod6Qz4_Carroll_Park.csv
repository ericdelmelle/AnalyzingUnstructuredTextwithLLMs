Climbing apparatus, slide, novelty bouncy features, swings and as a nice bonus, sprinklers for ""aquatic"" frolics in hot weather. Trees intermittently situated around the area provide shade during the summer and a beautiful rustling carpet of fallen leaves before autumn ushers in the first winter snow flurries. Paths to wander around and seats for relaxing and just simply chilling out. Carroll Park is and will remain a much appreciated and essential neighbourhood asset.",4

The 19th district police station and the fire department is within one block.

The pet owners are horrible, they allow their pets to poop and pee all over the grass and sidewalk, so you have to be watchful while taking a walk.

This park is used daily for the janazah prayers ( Muslim funeral prayers ) connected to Lenwood funeral home.

The businesses are booming ( childcare programs, corner stores, barbershops, etc. )

The community has to be more involved and responsible for the upkeep of the playground and areas. The city of Philadelphia sends someone daily to clean this playground üíö",3
