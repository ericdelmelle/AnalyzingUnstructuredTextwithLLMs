I grew up in Merion Station but as a kid I used to visit Belmont Plateau because‚Ä¶ In the late 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs outdoor concerts were held . Free outdoor concerts . I saw Leon Russell and I think it was the Ids of March and possibly Sea Train . Wonderful times .. Great memories‚Ä¶ Maybe that‚Äôs why some people call Belmont Plateau the old hippie park. Great times !

One thing I have to say is if you see large groups of kids / hoodlums get out of the area as quick as you can they terrorize people jumping on cars excetera excetera. I will be back again just be aware of your surroundings at all times.

The Philly skyline is the porridge: it‚Äôs just right. For the past thirty years, our skyline has made up for the lost time of a silly gentleman‚Äôs agreement. Now, instead of a laughed-at flat-top, from most angles it has an almost pyramidal grouping, a bell curve in our Bell town. The Comcast Innovation & Technology Center might throw that symmetry out of whack, but no one‚Äôs too upset that a Norman Foster tower will grow the skyline just a little more.

Definitely a must see for anyone who hasn't.. I am planing to get back to watch the sunrise from behiend the skyline I am positive it will be just as amazing if not more then the night view...

It does turn up at night so bring friends to hangout with,  just clean up your darn beer cans smh and watch out for racers although they mostly hang at the bottom of the Plateau lol. Also ideal for Moon gazing and has a pretty nice view of the Philly skyline ‚ú®"

A place called ""The Plateau"" is where everybody go
Guys out hunting and girls doing likewise
Honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beeping at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I composed this rhyme
To hit you and get you equipped for the summer time"

U cant walk 5 feet without seeing an empty beer can in the grass. Also the middle parking lot was taken over by an impromptu car show with burnouts and music. Lastly there were about 5 ATVs at any one time just flying through the park haphazardly. Not exactly an ideal place to take your kids.
Only plus for this park is the great view of the skyline on top of the hill"

It's a fine area to just chill and enjoy the scenery, with a fabulous view of the entire city skyline.

Back in the day (now I'm talking back in the 70s) percussionist used to gather down by the house which used to be a concession stand,they would be jamming it would seem like a 100 percussionists out there, congos, bongos, all types of percussion instruments. I would ride my bike out there, with my tamborine and cowbell and jam along with them. Always peaceful and lots of fun had. Bands (like ""Brutus"" comes to my mind) would also come out there with their own generators and jam!!!! Man, what happened to the good old days? Now, it's just a daze. ü§ó"

What can be either a treat or a disturbance for photographers is the large tree in the middle of the view. One can take left or right views of the skyline. But if you want the full skyline you need to walk a little into the lawn area or make the tree a center piece of your images.
