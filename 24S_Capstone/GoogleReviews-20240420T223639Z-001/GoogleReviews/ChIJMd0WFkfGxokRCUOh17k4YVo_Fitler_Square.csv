03/17/2024 01:30:43,Anwar Md Hossain,102007699294378549343,"Fitler Square, a charming neighborhood park in Philadelphia, is a half-acre haven of tranquility and natural beauty. Bounded by 23rd Street on the east, 24th Street on the west, Panama Street on the north, and Pine Street on the south, it‚Äôs a picturesque spot that offers a respite from the urban hustle. Named after the late 19th-century Philadelphia mayor Edwin Henry Fitler, the square is a testament to the city‚Äôs dedication to public spaces. With its well-maintained paths, seasonal flower beds, and a central fountain, Fitler Square is not just a park but a community gathering place that reflects the historic character of its surrounding neighborhood.",5

Should you ignore the signs, one of the many parents playing with their kids will tell you to ""take your dog to the dog park a few blocks away.""
I've lived in the neighborhood for 14 years, with my dog(s), don't bother doing anything with your dog but sitting quietly on a bench or strolling through, no one minds either of those.
Again, lovely place, just not for your dog to romp.",4
