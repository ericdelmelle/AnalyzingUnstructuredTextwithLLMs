08/05/2022 16:41:30,Business Opps,103283098611954499461,5,Nice safe place for the children to play. There's a playground for small children and a basketball court. There's benches and one table. Great place for a blanket. There's a barbershop and Slices pizza across the street.

Every time we go he makes a new friend. I enjoy watching him run and play. The wood chips used for the grounds are spongey so the kids that fall don't get hurt. Some ppl litter but every week when I go back there I see it has been cleaned."

03/24/2021 15:05:27,Rose Smith,105272677455160293878,4,"The kids love this little park, however only 4 stars because parents need to still watch their children. Some do and don't."

07/09/2018 21:29:06,Umm Kelechi,114165601994821323546,5,This park is nice and relaxing. It is also has some nice shaded areas and gate that closes to keep the little ones from running out. I usually come here with my daughters if I want to take them outside but I don't feel like a big park with many kids. The only problem which isn't related to the park is the cars don't really honor the pedestrian crossing space.

Really fun little park. Only thing we wish is that it had swings but the 4 awesome slides kinda make up for it.
