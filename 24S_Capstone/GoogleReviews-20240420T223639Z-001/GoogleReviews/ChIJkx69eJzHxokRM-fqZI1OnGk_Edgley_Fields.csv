I take my dog here and she loves it. Unfortunately, another dog owner did not have her dogs under control and they chased my dog and my friend. Was afraid they were going to get mauled. The owner was not at all concerned....which was quite concerning."

Adjacent to some rough neighborhoods. -1 star as it gets crowded, especially when there are other events such as rowing on the Schuylkill. Also needs a little more TLC from the city, sigh.."
