03/12/2023 23:18:00,Aaron Brauer,110918487218311731363,5,"Coming here from Bridesburg in hope of organization. So far they are starting softball practices immediately after sign ups so thats a plus. The fields are nice and well kept, the coaches undergo extensive backgrounds checks to include fingerprinting, even the assistant coaches. I am looking forward to see how the season goes and will update this when it is over."

08/18/2022 18:44:17,M C,103056091405496440014,5,I always go here to ground myself and walk my dog (who I clean up after because I'm not a jerk). I just saw people not cleaning up after their dogs a couple times lately and it's real messed up because when the people come to mow the field they shouldn't have to deal with random pooh getting flung all over and on their machines. I didn't physically see anyone leave the pooh I just saw a couple piles of poohs left there. I would have offered a bag to the person if I saw them physically leave it. Be mindful my fellow humans â™¡
