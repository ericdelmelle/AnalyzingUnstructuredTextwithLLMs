09/30/2021 22:44:30,Luke Sondergaard,102520574167486358626,3,"Perhaps ""Park"" is an inappropriate description of this small neighbourhood space. It seems occasionally to be a gathering place for what may be described as ""antisocial"" folks, in whose presence one may feel a little uncomfortable. Delightful if slightly tarnished seal and turtle sculptures. The trees and seats situated on a green grassy backdrop go someway to compensate for any negative impressions visitors may experience. In general terms though, a nice spot to stroll onto and chill out or just relax for a while."
07/12/2021 03:23:45,cool,106028800700686728173,2,The park is in disrepair and alot of crackheads and junkies roam around. The trashcans were removed a long time ago....
