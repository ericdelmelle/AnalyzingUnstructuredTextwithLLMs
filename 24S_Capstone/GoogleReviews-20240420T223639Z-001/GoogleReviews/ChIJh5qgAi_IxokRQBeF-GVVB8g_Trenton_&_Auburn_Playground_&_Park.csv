Although the area still has a lot of dilapaitaed and lonely buildings, there are the few that have been shown love and have been given a funky rehabilitation from dust and bones to colorful and hip lofts. A few old schools and churches remind us of the culture and style of the not so distant past. The area looks forward to moving ahead and hopefully into a rebirth of a new Kensington.",3
