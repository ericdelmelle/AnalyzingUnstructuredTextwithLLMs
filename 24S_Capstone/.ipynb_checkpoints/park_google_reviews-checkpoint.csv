Schuylkill Banks,Anwar Md Hossain,5,"Schuylkill Banks is a prime example of urban revitalization, transforming the Philadelphia waterfront into a vibrant and welcoming space for all.

The integration of nature and city life here exemplifies the potential for urban areas to provide residents with a balanced and healthy lifestyle.

Schuylkill Banks,Jeffrey Hsu,5,"So fortunate to have this artery running through the city. Just fantastic river side to run walk or bike.

You‚Äôll see people exercising from early morning to late at night. They have events during the summer like movie nights and you‚Äôll see groups of people hanging out and enjoying the evening time.

Not the entire length is lit up at night so you do have to be mindful about that. I would be nervous walking by myself and having dark corners here and there but that‚Äôs more a night thing than anything else.

When the river gets flooded parts get impacted but the city does a good job maintaining the length of the park and it‚Äôs a great way to get to Kelly drive and the art museum!",2022-07-08 02:20:33
Schuylkill Banks,The Duke Of Legends,5,"I love this park, it is a long walk with lots of sights and people going about working out or socializing.

Pennypack Park,Angela Z-Frace,4,"It's my hiking group's favorite trail to go for a long hike when we go to Philly area. But some parts of the trail can be very muddy after some rains.

The trails runs mostly along the Pennypack Creek, which can cause flooding after heavy rains. And there are a lot of parking lots along the trail. Many more f them have picnic areas. Some have pavilions. They are also good places to go for water fun during summer.",2023-12-22 04:03:51

Unfortunately, on weekends and holidays people have been partying by the creek and leaving a huge amount of rubbish. Little by little, what was beautiful has become a real and sad scene!

It‚Äôs a shame that the signs get vandalized on occasion but that‚Äôs city life I suppose. We love the creek and my dog who is no longer with us used to love playing catch in the water. The 2 main trails of of Rhawn Street entrance are great! We alternate walking between the 2. The upper is my favorite, because it‚Äôs very shaded so you can walk even in the worst heat and not really be subjected to the sun.",2023-07-18 16:35:28

Tacony Creek Park,Michael Diamond,5,"Love it, feels a little sketchy but great length from tip to tip 3 miles ish and almost entirely shaded with lots of cool tunnels and bridges. Warning feels very isolated, and many people ride dirt bikes and quads so it can be dangerous peak season",2020-09-16 18:44:44
Tacony Creek Park,True Review,4,If you like nature and all that it has to offer this might be the place for you. The park has a paved walkway which makes walking and biking easier. There are many places to sit and think or watch animals. I suggest that you stay out of the water though. It‚Äôs really not a swimming spot. It‚Äôs better maintained and feels safer than before.,2021-09-07 04:19:10
Tacony Creek Park,Wil Spillane,3,"This is an okay park. However, the trails run through busy streets. Considering how dangerous it is to be a pedestrian in America, I‚Äôd prefer to not have my hiking or walking interfered with by cars and intersections.",2022-11-18 18:12:05

FDR Park,Olivia Anderson,5,"Visited the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park yesterday evening. It‚Äôs the largest park in South Philadelphia. The large structure in some of the photos was originally built as a boathouse in 1916 and was used as the Russian Pavilion for the Sesquicentennial 1926 Exposition. The gazebo (also pictured) named the Olmsted Overlook sits on the edge of the lake and provides such a serene setting in the park. Like the Boathouse, the gazebo dates back to the 1900s. The park is beautiful, lots of free parking, and so many cute places for kids to play.",2023-09-01 13:34:27

Sedgley Woods Disc Golf,Daniel Coyne,5,"A place with ambiance like no other. Sometimes you‚Äôll come here and there will be 40-50 people hanging out in the patio area at the start/finish, grilling, playing music, enjoying libations, whatever. Multiple people will ask you if you want a burger or a drink or if you‚Äôd like to join them in playing a round. The people are what make this place so special. As far as the many comments saying it‚Äôs a ‚Äúshort course‚Äù, play from the reds. Blue tees are shortest, yellow medium, red tees are longest.",2022-12-06 16:43:15
Sedgley Woods Disc Golf,Jon jungle rot.,4,Great course. 27 holes with lots of pads for every level of player. If nothing else its just beautiful to look at. Give it a look if you are in town.,2022-03-03 23:36:35

Sedgley Woods Disc Golf,Tyler Davis,5,I've played several disc golf courses and this one is as good or better than the rest I have played and fortunately for me it's close by. Nice baskets and nice platforms to launch discs from. They take care of the garbage and recycling and usually have a couple porta potties there. As usual there is a lost and found in case you lose your disk. There are tournaments and even night games with string lights and glowing discs.,2020-06-01 09:32:38

Ellen Vagelos Field,Anwar Md Hossain,5,"Ellen Vagelos Field is a premier athletic facility located at the University of Pennsylvania. Opened in September 2013, it serves as the dedicated home for the university‚Äôs field hockey team. Nestled within the River Fields complex, it is flanked by Rhodes Field to the north and the Mondschein Throwing Complex to the south.

The facility not only enhances the athletic experience for players and fans alike but also stands as a testament to the university‚Äôs commitment to providing top-tier amenities for its sports programs.",2024-03-17 01:25:22
Ellen Vagelos Field,Scott Welling,4,"As a spectator - Awkward. Wedged-in tightly between railroad tracks and the interstate. Not the easiest place to get to for a first visit. Park at the ""One World Cafe"" lot, walk past the lacrosse and softball fields, take the pedestrian bridge across the tracks, proceed under the highway overpass and follow the path adjacent to the under-construction soccer complex(?) to Vagelos field. Bleacher seating is sparse, but nearly level with the pitch. I get it - it's an urban campus and real estate is at a premium. There was a small temporary restroom but no food or merchandise vendors.",2023-09-05 18:19:55
Ellen Vagelos Field,Jonathan Kinley,4,"Great Match Views.
Not easy to get to on public transportation.

Friends of Chamounix Tennis Courts,Akanksha Sinha,4,I liked the vicinity to my neighborhood and it's a free court. Well maintained and clean court. Free parking across the street. Trees will give ample shade to take rest in a sunny day. I wished some kind of wall to be there so that I could practice alone too.,2017-07-07 12:24:22
Friends of Chamounix Tennis Courts,John Rose,5,"The courts and nets are in nice shape by public court standards. Two of the courts are out of commission, and several others have some cracks but are playable. Overall, I have not seen a shortage of playable courts even on Sunday mornings.

What's really nice, compared to a lot of public courts, is that most of the courts are at least partially shaded. During those blazing hot summer days it's nice to be able to play in the shade!

Additionally the courts are (properly) situated more or less north-south instead of east-west. So you are not looking directly into the sun during mornings/evenings.

Each court has its own fence so you don't have to worry about disrupting (or being disrupted by) errant balls from adjacent courts.

Plenty of parking. There are also public bathrooms, but they always seem to be locked. Not sure what the deal is there.",2019-09-04 14:12:05
Friends of Chamounix Tennis Courts,Malarie Perelshteyn,5,"Great courts - some in better shape than others. My husband and I have been going to the Strawberry Mansion courts for years, but I think we're making the switch to Chamonix.

Feliz Filadelfia,Olympia Howell,1,"Today we went to this event. My son was excited to do something for Easter. We had hotdogs, chips, water and hot chocolate, definitely was going smooth. While waiting for space in one of the bouncy houses we noticed that it was really crowded with large kids and smaller kids. There were two different bouncy houses one was a replica of a boxing ring, and had huge boxing gloves for the children to use on each other. Some of the older children took the boxing gloves and brought them over to the bouncy house that was not the boxing ring. We looked around for any adults that were supposed to be supervising the two separate bouncy houses, but there was no one around. I saw who I thought to be the head of the organization. I asked him if there was anyone to supervise the two activities and he told me YES but sadly they both we not around. He then proceeded to ask me if there was a problem, and I told him of the larger children mixed in with the smaller children and how they had brought the boxing gloves to the other bouncy house. He laughed and asked me did anyone get hurt yet? I told him no and that no worries if someone were to get hurt, I would laugh too. He kept talking as I turned my back on him and gave him a peace sign over my shoulder. He then said to his group of male friends that someone always wants to be negative, I never thought that having concern for children was something negative. He finally dispersed from his group of five other men to go find the two adults that were supposed to be watching the bouncy houses one of the men that was supposed to be supervising was part of the group of men he was speaking with Ôøºand the female he claimed that was supposed to also be watching was over in the kitchen area socializing and mingling with other parents. I was completely irritated and was ready to start snapping but realize that neither him or his negative mindset was worth any more of my time or breath so I went over to Dollar General inside the Olney Plaza and brought him enough items to make three Easter baskets. ÔøºRight before I left a little boy went up to him and said that he was accidentally kicked in the face, I guess someone did get hurt.",2023-04-08 18:16:25

Ford Road Playground,William Cromwell,3,Small almost insignificant little playground with basic play constructions for children aged up to around ten years old. A redeeming feature thought is its lovely background setting. Located on a lush green grassy field with beautiful mature trees and meandering little bench lined paths. A natural environmentally precious nook within the greater confines of the city !,2021-12-11 11:28:21
Ford Road Playground,Daniel Buckley,4,Nice little park in a convenient location.  There is not a lot here for kids to play on (though there is enough) so I would suggest the park around the corner on Conshohocken that has more stuff but this location is great for just hanging out or for playing with your dog (note that it isn't a dog park though).,2017-01-27 11:13:59

Manayunk Canal,Elquis E,4,"For starters the Flat Rock RD address via GPS lead to a ""No outlet"" street. Therefore, could not access the Canal. Solution once on Leverington RD make a left. There are several access points on Main Street.
Trails are paved, unpaved and boardwalk, all along the canal. Beware, some do not have fenced barrier.
Interest,¬† quite a few murals with mosaic detail and bridges crossing over the canal.
The water not inviting. But the geese were having fun, also¬† nice to find a heron.
Worth Exploring!",2023-01-01 19:10:14
Manayunk Canal,tori okorodudu,5,"I love walking this path with my friends! The pictures I've taken are further down the path, but depending on which direction you take you will either reach abandoned train tracks that lead over the Schuylkill River (a very nice view! I've put the pictures here although they were taken in Fall) or another path that is surrounded by greenery that eventually leads to a dam that overlooks the river (I've also put those pictures here)

There are many shops near this path on Main Street, but I wouldn't take too much food on the path with you unless you have a bag to carry it in because once you go deeper down the path there are not many trash cans.

I don't often cross the train tracks, there is an old dilapidated sign there that says ""No Trespassing"" so if you're concerned about that type of thing you can go on the tracks, take a picture and then leave. If you have more of a sense of adventure you can go down the tracks and find a route that leads to another path on the other side of the river. I wouldn't recommend taking small children here

The dam is harder to get to. When you get on the canal and face the water, you're going to want to turn right and continue walking down that path until you hear running water (or see it through the trees). From there you can cut through the woods and get to the dam. If you're walking the right way, you will eventually get to a bridge, don't cross it. Stay on the right side of the water and go under the bridge.

Overall a nice walk, especially since it's getting warmer now. You can also bring some bread because there are geese and ducks in the water. Sometimes they're with their babies, its so cute!",2021-05-18 15:51:21

The performers kept mentioning the bugs too. Replacing the lights with yellow ones that don't attract bugs would help. The stage is right next to the fountain which makes noise. Might be better to turn off the fountain during the concerts if that's possible. There's no light and no walkways, so after the concert it's tricky not to trip over tree roots. Bring a flashlight.

Kay Center,Ty Gould Jacinto,5,"I recently had the opportunity to visit the Kay Environmental Center in Chester, NJ, and I was thoroughly impressed. The center is on a beautiful 223-acre site with various habitats, including meadows, forests, and wetlands. We used this short time for a photo shoot and the photos were impressive as amateurs.
From the moment I arrived, I was struck by the center's warm and inviting atmosphere. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the facilities were clean and well-maintained. I especially enjoyed the sun porch, which offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape.
The highlight of my visit was getting an idea of the center's extensive walking trails. From what I could see, the trails appeared well-maintained and easy to follow, and they offered various scenic views. I was particularly impressed by the large, old trees that surrounded the building.
In addition to its natural beauty, the Kay Environmental Center also offers a variety of educational and recreational programs. I attended a meeting of the TNC, which was informative and engaging.
I highly recommend the Kay Environmental Center to anyone looking to explore, learn, or enjoy the outdoors. It is an extraordinary place that I will be returning to soon.",2023-12-01 14:55:01

I love that they provide various sized life jackets for kids and section off multiple parts of the pool for different ages and swim abilities- personally i think it's also so the the adults and older kids are not bothered in the deep end by all the younger ones splashing and boisterous screams. The pool is always clean and the crowd isn't rowdy. Another bonus is there is the rec center attached to it, as well as, basketball courts, a park and numerous others around.",2019-08-21 01:31:44

I usually come here with my daughters if I want to take them outside but I don't feel like a big park with many kids.

No food allowed on pool deck but there are nice shaded picnic tables right outside you can eat at. Also. There was no trash or food wrappers near the pool so that was nice. They have a capacity limit There was no line when we arrived (it was a weekday) but there was a short line by the time we left. The summer 2023 hours are posted below. Keep in mind free swim isn‚Äôt available the whole time they‚Äôre open.
The bathrooms were clean but they only had a few toilet stalls, a changing table and two sinks. I was hoping for lockers, changing rooms and showers but it is a free public pool.",2023-07-07 01:31:09
John B. Kelly Pool,Ashley,5,"Great public pool in a beautiful location. Clean, ample free parking, and a lot of open space/picnic tables in the vicinity.

Note: once they hit capacity you have to line up outside the gate. When there's a long enough line (maybe every hour or so) they ask everyone to leave and get in line so others have a chance to swim. Get to the pool right when they open to avoid the line.

Also, with the lifeguard shortage, only a small portion of the pool is available for open swim. It can get a bit crowded.

This is a great community resource! I will be going back many times this summer!",2022-07-05 15:00:41
John B. Kelly Pool,Aliyah Shaw,3,"The lady at the gate was a bit rude, and she gave us so many rules but was happy to ignore the group of extremely rowdy boys that were splashing wildly and play fighting. Also, the lifeguard seemed to be friends with the boys and did absolutely nothing despite my 9 year old getting splashed. Black kids deserve to come and cool off but it‚Äôs annoying when one group ruins it for everyone else.",2023-07-31 20:45:56

My favourite part of the park is the creek. I found it to be a calming and healing experience to just walk along the creek or sit on the big rocks at its edge and just listen to the sounds of nature.

He has done some great things for that city and its people included rehabilitating prisoners by teaching them to landscape, grow plants and garden.

As with many areas in Center City, there may be pools of urine and people passed out on the benches but they generally don't cause major issues, just watch where you step. Regardless, it's a very nice little secluded gem I never noticed despite walking almost directly past it many times.

John F. Collins Park,LaShawnDa L. Pittman,5,"I‚Äôm honestly not sure where to begin. Magical. Professional. The Olivia Pope of event organizing. Lol. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Jhona Ireland, the Event Sales Manager at Center City District (CCD). As the chair of one the largest sections within the American Sociological Association (ASA) (a non-profit), I had a minimal budget for organizing a joint reception with another Section. I scoured the city for something that would fit our needs and satisfy the ASA‚Äôs offsite reception requirements (e.g., contract review, access, contingency plans, etc..). It was a TALL order with lots of ‚Äúalmost possibilities‚Äù that didn‚Äôt pan out.

By the time I connected with Jhona, I was at my wits end. To say that her professionalism, hard work, and resourcefulness turned the whole experience around for me‚Äîis an understatement. I felt like I had the partner I desperately needed to pull this off and put it together. Jhona used her deep networks and ability to think outside the box and her dogged determination to overcome roadblocks largely driven by our limited budget. I took comfort in her ability to work with me and my group to find solutions to problems that arose, to answer emails in a timely manner, and to efficiently process paperwork‚Äîall while doing so long-distance and virtually. My organizers and I were told that we hosted the best reception at the conference not only because the space itself was so beautiful and magical, but also because it was arranged with such elegance and thoughtfulness (the linens, flowers on the tables, lighting, and bartender and dessert stations)‚Äîthank you Aaron Walters, CCD‚Äôs Manager of Event Logistics, who was also incredible to work with! Thank you LaShon Green for your ""A Sweet Surprise"" dessert station! People raved about the treats!

I didn‚Äôt think Jhona could be any more amazing until meeting her in person ! She was gracious and easy to work with on the ground. I had to do little more than show up not only because the work we put in beforehand made that possible, but also because Jhona and Aaron made it possible! Don‚Äôt think twice about booking an event with CCD and working with this incredible team! It‚Äôll be one of the best decisions you would have made as you organize your special event.",2023-08-29 18:35:41

Ann Taylor,Karolyn Denson Landrieux,1,"From the moment I entered the store I felt unwelcome. I was treated as persona non grata. I was the only customer in the store and with good reason. As an older woman of color i need assistance finding clothing that fits properly. Gone are the days when I could breeze into a store and grab the size 4 off the rack without trying it on.
I tried conversing with the overly coiffed woman that was perched behind the counter‚Ä¶dead pan. She snatched the place the plastic bag off the counter from the dress that i was returning. I wanted to exchange a couple pieces. I dont like my clothing to feel tight. I like a looser fit. She basically threw the jeans back at me. I attempted to purchase the dress slacks in a larger size because it would need to be mailed to my address. They didnt have it in the store. When I placed my Chase Sapphire card in the card reader for the purchase she asked me if it was a gift card, but it was said with contempt as if I couldnt possibly have any money. These are all micro aggressions. This is what marginalized women feel on the daily. If I‚Äôm dropping hundreds to thousands of dollars I refuse to pay for you to treat me poorly. I grabbed my Nordstrom bags and let my Gucci loafers carry me out as quickly as possible. I will NEVER buy Ann Taylor brand again.

Pick nick tables and benches can be found through out the park. A playground for the kids is next to the lake. I saw several people fishing and one section has peer that extends into the lake. A well maintained disk golf is also part of of the park. It also has wooded areas where a creek runs through. Park is well kept and has a multitude of things to do and enjoy. ‚ù§Ô∏è,2020-07-07 17:52:55

I walk by here frequently, but hardly ever see anyone using this park.  They have some nice benches, good plants and a great grassy area.  No dogs are allowed at all which is a shame and probably why it's never used.",2021-10-13 17:46:22

Ralph Brooks Park,Lindsay D,5,"I used to drop by this place years ago, while walking my dog. It's a great experience to view the mural arts and community garden (if still there?) The basketball court used to be junk, now it was renovated and looks great. Small, but very community driven.

Also a very small kids play area with a few pieces of nicely designed , but requires a bit of skill-type of equipment to explore in the back, behind the basketball court...

My photos are mostly dated. But it's still nice to remember that things were there, and after gentrification took over the area.

Ralph Brooks Park,William Cromwell,4,"It is not all about the basketball, although this park has good facilities for the sport. It is also about neighborhood focus, a place for folks to gather, socialise, enthuse and analyse every play, pitch and point scoring lob. Basketball played with skill is a thing of beauty, mazy dribbles, quick fire passing and those glorious angular shots resulting in that great ""kerplunk"" sound as the ball find its target. How poignant it is to see a ""Stop the Violence"" mural nearby emphasizing the need for young people to orientate towards places like this instead of the streets.",2021-09-25 08:39:09

They reflect the great sorrow as well as the optimism of Irish immigrants arriving to start a new life in America. The sculpture was moved in fall 2023 to the Foglietta Plaza on Front and Spruce.

Numbers of casualties, missing, captured, and injured are displayed in front  of a wall saying ""Freedom is not Free"".  The memorial now has a wall sort of like the Vietnam wall, but in a huge circle.  It is organized by branch then rank alphabetically, and has the names of 36,574 American servicemen and more than 7,200 members of the Korean Augmentation troops.

The Wall of Remembrance has the names of 36,574 Americans and 7,114 of the Korean Augmentation to the US Army.  Admission is free. I recommend just taking the train and walking over here.

It also features ten panels that depict scenes of the war, providing a narrative journey from the conflict‚Äôs beginning to the final rescue of Vietnamese refugees in 1975.

So, we asked him to remake it, he said no that that's how they just make it, I stated I'll like to return for a refund. He stated I could not get one because 1 I ordered it and 2 he did not know how to do a refund. I asked for the manager he stated the owner wasn't there that I had to wait for the owner. I inquired did he step away how long will the manager return he stated he didn't know and if I wanted a refund that's the only way I could receive one.

Hopefully, they fix the basketball courts which are very neglected which are around Cobbs Creek & Christian Sts.",2024-02-20 08:40:51
Cobbs Creek Park,Casey ROSS,5,"Cobbs Creek Park essentially consists of three different things: an asphalt recreational trail along Cobbs Creek Parkway between Race Street and Woodland Avenue; a gravel trail along the Creek's eastern edge between Spruce Street and Baltimore Avenue, and completely un-improved, wild woodlands full of deer paths, unofficial man-made trails, and secret bits of old infrastructure.

The asphalt trail, part of the East Coast Greenway, provides easy access to facilities such as basketball courts, tennis courts, playgrounds, and picnic areas. It also connects to the Laura Sims Skate Rink and the Cobbs Creek recreation Center between Spruce and Walnut Streets, and the Cobbs Creek Environmental Center at Catharine Street. Many of these are regularly used by the community, and on a nice day you'll see lots of people out and about grilling, playing sports, walking their dogs, exercising, and walking.

The gravel trail is a hilly, unpaved path the runs along the Creek's edge. It starts just north of Spruce Street but is most easily-accessible from the Southwest corner of Spruce Street and Cobbs Creek Parkway. The trail is within the Creek's flood plain so after a big storm it can get pretty messed up, but it is maintained and things like fallen trees are always eventually cleared. It's more isolated than the paved asphalt trail and there is no lighting so at night it's completely dark, but it provides a lovely place to take a walk through the woods. It's usually used by people walking or riding bikes, but you also have to look out for people on illegal dirt bikes and ATVs sometimes.

Most of Cobbs Creek Park is comprised of unimproved woodlands. The only capital improvements the City has ever made to Cobbs Creek Park were installed in the 1930s, when WPA funds were used to create the original Cobbs Creek Recreational Trail. Many White Tailed Deer live in these woods and they've created a network of deer paths that criss-cross the creek from the north end of the park to its southern tip. Humans use these deer paths as unofficial trails, and have created some of their own trails that are maintained mostly through use and probably the care of one or two individuals who clear and mark them.

The unofficial trails are all over the place. Some are used my more people than others, and many of them are usually deserted. There are several locations obviously used as ""secret places"" with manmade lean-tos and clubhouses stashed along the creek here and there, as well as some sparsely-occupied homeless encampments. Wandering through the remote areas of the woods can feel uneasy and unsafe at times, but provides for fun hiking and exploring opportunities if you're up for it.",2021-01-13 16:41:15
Cobbs Creek Park,Roderick Wortham,5,"Cobbs Creek is my most favorite place to be in the entire world. A big wooded area where the parks and recreations were built along the creek that flows through. The park is awesome, the trails are great, and you can get lost in the natural scenery. Huge location too so you can always find a spot to chill, grill, play basketball, walk, hike, or whatever else floats your boat. Highly recommended.",2023-08-18 20:15:46

Cobbs Creek Park,Jd Neely,5,"Great space with even greater potential. I love playing tennis here or just watching the passers-by.
... AND THE DEER seem to come through almost every day. They usually show in pairs but sometimes there'll be 5 or more. Doe and fawn. I've never seen  a buck near the basketball courts, tennis courts or the kiddie playground, though. They visit in early afternoon mostly. They like eating the east-facing foliage, apparently.
The park needs a little more work and care to really achieve its best look. As the people who care join forces, I believe others will demand the needed attention be given. I feel very optimistic about its future appeal, even while the site desperately needs real restrooms and water fountains for the joggers, tennis and ball players. Maybe a dog park would be nice!

The Rail Park,Dan Zena,3,"This park reminds me of a developing and mini ""High Line"" that you'll see in NYC. Its cool usage for an abandoned rail line and as of right now looks pretty cool. Nothing much too see as of yet but its a cool spot to explore or if you need some green space, some quiet from Center City. There are a lot of homeless that do hang around here but from my experience, they really just try to find some peace and quiet and never bothered anyone. This park looks cool and hopefully they continue to add more to it.

PROS:
-Cool concept
-Quiet, spacious, not far from the Center City/downtown area of Philly
-Sort of low key and never really packed (as of now)

CONS:
-I have seen homeless around here but never felt sketchy. The homeless I have seen here tend to visit here to be left alone and get some peace and quiet. Usually reading, napping, etc. But if this is a concern for you, just proceed cautiously.",2023-09-07 15:41:09
The Rail Park,Juliana,4,The Noble St entrance is not easily accessible from Broad St. Due to nearly building construction you have to walk through the middle of the street which does not feel safe. Overall it‚Äôs a good idea but it seriously needs funding for expansion. The signs say there is a plan for phase 2 but there was clearly no expansion construction happening. There seems to be a lot of dead space with wide walkways. I hope this expands in the future because it has potential to be great.,2023-05-22 00:55:23

However, it‚Äôs a pretty neat spot to check out. Parking is near impossible. I went a few years ago during summer. There was no shade and pretty hot. But there was a pop-up beer garden under the rail park. Not much to do at this park, but worth a visit. I went back this year during winter.

Maplewood Mall,Pang Vang,1,"Don't pay 3 bucks for the carousel, waste of money. All the horses had a 100 lbs limited. The employee started the ride when I was putting my baby on the horse, then during the middle of the ride, she come out yelling at us to get off the horse during the ride because there was a 100 lbs limited that inform us or see. Employee was rude to us, I request a refund and to speak with the manager, she was rude and refused, when I started to record the accident she stop talking.

Maplewood mall needs to close it down because of safety concerns, they should inform us before when they started the ride, we would of left.

The employee put us at risk and we couldn't even enjoy the ride.

She wouldn't refund my money n stop the ride early and than offer a new customer 3 free rides, wow.

I'm forwarding my video to attorney General and hope that Maplewood Mall take safety concerns into hand. The employee said she will not refund me because I didn't not read the policy on the windows, 1st off as an employee you should info us and not scams people's also start a ride without checking on the customer so no one will get hurt, instead of coming out of the booth during the ride yelling us to get down during the ride.

I would of post the video on here but it didn't allow me too so I screen shot the employee.

The things that also got me mad too, was she said parents doesn't need to be on the carousel because we are adults and its a kids.",2024-03-13 03:17:23
