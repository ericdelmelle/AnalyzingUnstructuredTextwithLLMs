What a great idea to build a parkway that leads to a roundabout with th city in the background. Anyone who flys drones should consider this shot a must have when visiting Philadelphia. What a beautiful sight. I am glad we had time after our trip to Lancaster to stop here.

02/03/2018 01:31:04,Ron,106474851025332062734,5,"This is pulsating heart of Center City Philadelphia and not far from 15th and JFK Blvd near City Hall and the Liberty Bell. There is much American history that can be explored here as well. Many festivals and concerts are held here throughout the year on 4th of July for the Independence Day holiday and Labor Day. The Philadelphia Art Museum and an amazing Rocky statue can be seen here as well. This part of Philadelphia has good restaurants and hotels on the parkway and it's ideal for bicycling, jogging, horse carriage rides, or a game of Frisbee! Philadelphia is a great and cosmopolitan city and it's always something fun and cool to explore here for the whole family!"
