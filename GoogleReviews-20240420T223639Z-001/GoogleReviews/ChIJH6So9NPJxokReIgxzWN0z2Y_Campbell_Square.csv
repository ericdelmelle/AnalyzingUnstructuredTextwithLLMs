Also very dog-friendly. Depending on the time of the day, many of the neighbors will come with the dogs for a walk and socialize.
If you like to run, the sidewalks are in good shape and not usually crowded. (I usually do laps around the square for exercise).
You'll occasionally find trash in the ground and homeless sleeping on the benches, but that is uncommon.",4

I'm greatful for the people I met with and talked to.
But I would not recommend going there
If you don't look like the people who go to walk their dogs you will get stared at, talked about and pointed at..
Make sure you have yoga pants on a dog ((DEFINITELY)) and alcohol cause other than that I promise you you'll be stared at",1

This park really brings people together in the neighborhood. ¬†Just last month it was the host of a huge flea market that drew hundreds of people and was a huge success.¬† It's a small neighborhood park. People try to keep it clean but it's hard. Nice if your walking and you wanna just sit for ¬†a few minutes. They have several event's here during the year. For the even'ts I'll say its good. Other wise its just a park. It's a cool area.
