At the plaza, you can take a nice picture with/of the City Hall, and also with the letters ‚ÄúLOVE‚Äù. But if you come here only to see the plaza, it‚Äôs probably not worth it. Both the ‚ÄúLOVE‚Äùsign and the plaza itself are tiny and hard to spend more than five minutes without getting bored. Parking is very hard: expect to park a few blocks away where it might be possible to find metered street parking spots. When we arrived, there was lots of ugly stuff lying around (like stands, boxes, baskets), making it hard to enjoy the view, left alone taking good pictures."

12/17/2023 05:49:50,Jennifer Wolfenden,102636421075198169079,5,A friend and I were recently there for the Christmas market. There were a lot of new things this year and we both felt it was set up a lot better than in years past. And there was some thing for everyone. We just happened to be there when someone got engaged at the love statue! A really great atmosphere and I would recommend it to anyone visiting at this time of year.

Compared to Chicago, this city feels safer, yet the violent crime is on the rise. The tension in the air is softened by the lovely nature of the Philadelphians.
I find these people here to be more open and warmer.. despite what they say about themselves.

Around the city, it's reasonably safe, clean, and pleasant to walk around as there are many historical buildings reflecting a time rich with historical and monumental events.

I was never very fond of the US, yet I find myself thinking that this city is livable. ~ a note to self, I see plenty of opportunities here."

Stopping by early in the day is recommended if you want to take photos with the LOVE sign or get something to eat or drink because the crowd builds quickly and there tends to be a long wait after 12:30.

If you've ever seen or been to a Christmas market in Europe it is very similar but with wares that have a distinct Philly flair.  All in all plenty to keep folks who like a little holiday hustle and bustle happy and keep those who just want to get a drink and people watch happy too.

Leave your double wide strollers at home... There's not a lot of maneuvering room and it's not a great place for extra wide strollers.  I'd almost recommended no stroller, but the entire park is accessible to wheeled devices so just be conscious that space is at a premium.

Love Park is in general a nice place to stop and bring a lunch from a nearby deli during the week and a good site that is often used for public political protests and speeches as well as city events."

You never know the sights you will see when you visit. Also it's across from the Dillworth where you can play a quick fun game of pickle ball plus out side dining with wine! The ice skating rink is in the process now and I'm geeked and can't wait to ice skate.  My friends and I take advantage of the scenery for  pictures all the time.

During my morning visit to JFK Plaza, I couldn't help but be amazed. This urban oasis is a perfect retreat in the bustling city.

With its spacious and well-maintained greens, it's an ideal spot for relaxation. The presence of comfortable benches only enhances the experience, providing a serene place to sit and take in the surroundings.

What's more, JFK Plaza is a pet-friendly haven, making it perfect for animal lovers. The view from this park is simply breathtaking, offering a unique perspective of the cityscape.

I highly recommend this place to all tourists. It's a hidden gem in the heart of the city, where you can unwind and soak in the beauty of Philadelphia. Don't miss out on this tranquil and scenic escape! üå≥üêæüåÜ.

If you're homeless, you can get all sorts of food and donations from people like the legendary Chicken Man (200 people each week line up for this). Additionally if you're homeless you can sleep on the chairs around the fountain at night and only have half of your stuff stolen. Speaking of the fountain, stick your head in during Philly's endless death heat, no one cares. Once I danced here with a random stranger who was making a video, just her and me, and turns out she was borderline famous.

So have fun! Love Park is for lovers."

It's a great environment, and my husband and I have actually enjoyed eating and taking our 1 year old there a couple times, for him to enjoy the water and tub around. You do have to watch your items because they're is homelessness there, so have someone watch your belongings if you choose to go into the water and get wet, or have a bookbag on!"

Needless to say the park destroyed my childhood spirit by look like the great plains, flat and barren. I asked my uber driver if there was another love park since it looked completely different than what I‚Äôve seen in videos and he said no, this is it. Very disappointing. More people need to stand up for the city they live in and not allow this type of stuff to happen."

Kathe Wohlfahrt is a must visit. Of note they do not accept cash. But have various tree ornaments, among other things that are of interest and great for personal collection or gift.
Overall pricey and parking is a challenge.
Venture across the street to Dilworth for other fun fill things to do.
Worth exploring!"

I came here when it was raining and was actually looking forward to seeing the early 2000s version of this park but i understand why they re did the entire thing. Definitely worth checking out.

My issue is the venders are always closed. At least when I get by their and have been often lately. With an Eagles event going, I can't grasp why a business owner would not be open.

I see signs they closed early on days of slow business but on high volume days they still are closed.

If you're an owner of a park business, I would be glad to consult your active ownership and ready research to be prepared for high volume and know when it will be there."

There was a splash section for the kids and they seemed to be enjoying themselves.  There is really nothing to do here.  I was expecting a place where my family and I could  relax, spread out a picnic blank and enjoy the scenery of the city but NO!  PHILADELPHIA HAS TO DO BETTER! If you want to be the city of brotherly Love, then you have to have attractions that exude or convey love.

By the way, there is a lot of homelessness in Philadelphia and they are everywhere at every business. Be careful! We walked from Reading Market (0.3mi away) and there were people sleeping on steps, having conversations with themselves, and staring at you as you passed by.  I give what I can to help as I can (a bottle of water or food, etc.) but homelessness is everywhere in Philadelphia!"

Nat√ºrlich mit dem ikonischen ""Love""-Zeichen, unter dem man Fotos machen kann. Auf der R√ºckseite des Platzes das weniger bekannte ""I ‚ô•Ô∏è Philly"", das aber auch ein gutes Motiv abgibt.

Also ein Muss f√ºr jeden Philadelphia-Touristen.

Kennedy Plaza, has two iconic signs -- the Love installation and the I ‚ù§Ô∏è Philly.  What I love is a visitor can pose next to one of these signs and the photo will come out nicely.  The signs do much of the work.  There is a Love Park Fountain which is refreshing for kids during the warm months.  The best pictures are on a summer day even if overcast and the colors will come out vibrant.  I went in the summer and late fall.  The late fall photos struggle with the reds.  More grass and seating areas would enhance this park.  Maybe have an artistic competition where people can submit designs for benches.  Trees would be good to take on some of the heat, but would block the views of the lovely buildings.  Maybe put a cluster of trees off to the side where visitors can go for respite.  It's a hot park in warm months with the heat bouncing off the cement and stone."

A lot of Philly folks experiencing homelessness seem to call this home during the daylight hours, occupying seating by the fountain, using the fountain to get clean, and blasting music under the trees that line the park.

Splash with caution. Also there should be a place on where to store small items for the available outdoor activities like the ping pong table. Those items are in the risk of being stolen or lost.

The park is more a square with tables and chairs to sit, relax, and take in the atmosphere. The park is 15 minute walk from the famous Philadelphia Art Museum (Rocky Steps) or 7 minute walk from Reading Terminal Market, making it a great stop on a walking tour whatever your pace."

Before this park was redone you would have to search hard to find a seat in it especially during the lunch hour. People would especially gather around the wall to just watch the water flow from the fountain. Something about water, it can bring a sense of peacefulness.  It was a beautiful traditional fountain that drew you into the park.  Today it's just water shooting out of an aluminum cylinder. Barely anyone, residents of Philly or visitors want to relax in this cold uninviting park."

I believe that it will be on display until the end of February.

It's such a moving piece.   One can see and feel the determination in her face as she flees north to freedom.    There are many other things to see or do around City Hall which itself is a beautiful building with Billy Penn's larger than life statue perched atop.   On the opposite side of City Hall is also the statue of Ocavius Catto an African American of note.

Love Park is across the street and there was the remnants of the Christmas Village that had been up and running over the recent Christmas Holidays.

Love Park is always a great place to visit to feel the pulse of Philadelphia."

I did purchase a few items from Amira's Delights & Barefoot Botanicals. The last picture is a lovely personal size cheese cake. Please check them out there is still time before Christmas.

Surrounding that open space, where events do sometimes take place, there is an outside eatery calles The Lawn where the food and drinks are very good. I tried their Shrimp Po'Boy, Chicken Fingers and curly fries and I had a drink that was called Grapefruit Punch (I could be wrong on the name but it's very good and it sneaks up on you so be careful) and I ate and drank everything! There is also a bean bag game you can play and a lounge area if you just want to chill and drink amongst the other diners.  The service was fast and the servers were pleasant.  There is a small fountain, the scenery is very ""Philadelphian"" and don't forget to take a pic in front of the famous LOVE statue."

Look left or right and find well sculptured statues and fine architecture, along with people exercising, site seeing, kissing, hugging, fellowshipping, working, and some unfortunately down on their luck and it makes you think about LOVE- and how much the world needs more of it.
Downtown is filled with a city full of ideas, life, creativity, and skilled design. This is the city nicknamed The City of Brotherly Love. So much important history here dated back to decorations and bills being signed and so much more. Pay it a visit of you can; put it on your bucket list. You can drive but parking is scare in this particular area but there is underground parking, just pay close attention to signs. The Septa train is also available."

I highly recommend you get a photo with the famous sign - just be aware that you might encounter strangers trying to charge you for them to take a photo (just ignore them though). All in all I hope you (and the family) have as much fun as we did ^_^"

I can't help but think of him anytime I go there. Anyway definitely a perfect little stop to get hydrated if biking in the city and you happen to get dehydrated. I would suggest doing this with the right partner to make sure you don't have memories you wish you never made.

Weekends the noise from dance republic sound system rattles the windows of residents 3 blocks away. No one stops the decibel level from reaching a level against code 10/ nuisance law.  Hence my review is go on a weekday in the day time. Do not rent or buy an apartment anywhere near this noisy noisy park.

Honestly I thought there was more to this park then there was.  It was so cool and nice out so we walked down to Logan Square.  SO nice down there and an amazing waterfountain. Side note,  the parking below Love park is amazing.  It's locked so you feel secure and your car. Not as pricey as the other lots either.  I was pleasantly surprised."

You order and pay online with 20% service charge included. We ordered drinks in pouches which were okay I was expecting alcohol in them but it just tasted like juice.
The elote came as 4 little piece of corn with some sort of sauce on them that wasn‚Äôt not appetizing and a bit spicy. Once we wiped the sauce off, the corn was fine but this was not traditional Mexican street corn. The love burger was perfect the way it came.

This is a new place that was redesigned to prevent skateboarding but actually just took a piece of the city's culture away. People came from all over the world to skate and watch skateboarding at love park. But thanks to Philadelphia politicians, rich folk who say their tax dollars went to the awful Paines skatepark(you know, the people who pay lower taxes because of their high income),  former mayor Michael Nutter, and a whole other bunch of worthless people. What they turned this place into has made me want to move out of Philadelphia for 5 years now. I really hope people understand how bad this was to a lot of people. Everyone stresses social issues, this is one that should be addressed. It was a place where friends of all colors and backgrounds came together to enjoy a common activity. I could rant and express more anger in this review but I want people to know, from me, who has spent 100,000+ hours skateboarding in what used to be love park, that this is a social tragedy. Personally it took a large piece of my life away for nothing. The current state of the park is dull, full of trash, and all the other undesirable things skateboarding used to regulate. But what do oblivious politicians know from their comfy offices. Nothing. They know nothing. They are nothing and I hope that one day when their time comes like everyone else, they were nothing. If any billionaire wants to put this place back together I will do all the labor myself. That would be one of the best philanthropic moves a rich person could do. Unlike charities and all that kind of donation, this would actually help people. I dare one of you billionaires to restore love park. I'm calling you all out now. I dare you. If you're not scared to actually help something for real then I dare you to do this."

I'm sorry Peta had to be out front trying to discourage people from having a good time with their spreading of false information, they honestly do more harm than good in their fight and it's sad. Everything followed a strict COVID protocol which not only kept everyone safe but also allowed each person to have some personal space which is great for people who have claustrophobia."

It was exciting to hear the sounds of music that filtered the air and to see the lights at the Christmas Village, and the look of joy and hope on the faces of the merchants, the very young and the seniors from so many diverse groups of people. However,  it was a sad eye opener seeing the dark side of the realities of the streets as we gave out socks and gloves. The mentally and physically challenged, the homeless, the hungry and those clothed with unclean clothes that barely fit to keep them warm from the elements. All in the mist of this deadly pandemic with no mask on. All allegedly ,put out on the street from the shelters with no assigned destination, just wandering about til it's time to return to the place where some of them call home.
May each of us be filled with Gratitude for the little or much that we do have. Be Blessed and Be a Blessing to some one in need even in these trying times. For your little is much to those that have not, in Jesus name"

It was smaller than I had thought,  as with the iconic sign, but that didn't make it any less special.  Coming from the west coast I was under the impression, so many say, that the west coast cities have a homeless issue... Well judging by how many brothers and sisters I saw homeless at the park, maybe people only notice homeless white people then (at least the west coast homeless). It saddens me to see people in such dire straights, laying on cardboard placed atop the grating so the subterranean heat source can keep them warm enough to sleep. Not just a left coast thing... Please Philly, show your brotherly love and help your citizens."

ATEN√á√ÉO: um cara estava se oferecendo para tirar foto sua no letreiro. Ele parecia ser muito gentil mas depois de tirar a foto ele pedia dinheiro. Mas como h√° sempre turistas no local, pe√ßa para um deles tirar a foto para vc.

H√° tamb√©m um chafariz na pra√ßa √≥timo para se refrescar em dias quentes."

It becomes a hub of the  Christmas village. Shops with souvenirs, various food and drink ( including cr√™pe, mulled wine or glowine, bratwurst, doner kebabs). Of course, the true essence still lies in the 'i love philly' structures. Diagonally opposite to this is the dillworth park - another attraction during Christmas time with light show on the City Hall and a skating rink for all ages to enjoy."

Ice skating, ferris wheel and merry go round all too damn cold for me but, it looked fun for the brave ones doing it. Lol. This will be my new must do every year. I love my city"

12/16/2019 00:23:12,Msworldwide1,115066438863115073835,5,This was the perfect location for our engagement photo shoot. Fortunately for us the same day there were vendors in the park and a little concert going on. It was really nice and made for a perfect day for our engagement photo session.  The parking in this area is terrible but there is a parking garage attached to the park so you have to walk a bit of a distance.
12/15/2019 23:52:44,Al Lamartine,109055419962910000664,2,"I went there at the christmas village time. Great time. Ice skating, lots of craft shops, lots of food and drink shops. Now for the negative. The port-o-potties were disgusting and made me glad I am a man and only had to pee. Every toilet seat was covered in pee and good luck finding one with toilet paper in it. With having a place attracting a lot of tourists it makes a person want to make sure they don't ever come back without bringing their own toilet paper. When I think of things that I don't want to have to worry about bringing with me when I leave the house, toilet paper is at the top of the list. The big tree was nice and the giant present made of lights was nice but not nice enough to make me ever want to go back again üòî"

The Love logo is more.iconic than the park and will always be used for various things throughout the city but the park itself isn't really that appealing anymore.

Garden with reindeers, ferris wheel $4, train $3,  carousel $3(free coloring book at this ride), parents if your taking child on you must also buy a ticket. Rides are at city hall. Tons of vendors at both love park and City Hall. Bring cash as yes people take card but lots of places are cash only.  You can park across street for $10 bucks after 5pm. Photo Op with Santa for $20 smackers but he's a great Santa.  New boot mug this year and only $5, can try wine and shots at some vendors. Plus you walk to Macy's during your visit just a few blocks away."

11/10/2019 05:04:12,Judah Daugherty,110387815566547600835,4,"This is a nice spot to see Philadelphia. Because it's considered a state park, it is closely watched by park police. This keeps the riff raff away for the most part. There are two really neat signs that represent the city well. It's also a good starting point to explore more of the city itself. There's a very accessible parking garage right below that we park in every time we visit the city. Definitely a must see if you're coming to Philly."

This is a great place to take lots of selfies, a must visit park while visiting the city, food trucks are also around if you are hungry.

From here you can walk to Benjamin Franklin Pkwy. All the way to the Rocky Steps.

Also had a ping-pong table and some sort of booth that said something about a scavenger hunt or game in the park. (Not sure specifics as we didn't stop.) Lots of chairs and places to sit as well as grassy areas. The downside is the park has a LOT of homeless people on all sides. There are also these large grates that go down probably to a drainage area of some sort and we saw one woman pull down her pants, sit on the grate and pee. I only saw one police officer entire 2 days we were in the city (not counting NPS security at historic sites) and well over 200 homeless. Most sat or laid quietly or held signs but we were approached on more than one occasion."

It was so tiny since all of the pictures of it make it look like if you stand next to it you‚Äôd be shorter than the fixture. We did ‚Äúcut‚Äù the line to take a picture under the statue by taking a selfie with it in the background instead. The fountains are really nice.

The Love statue is no longer a center piece but was relocated to the corner closest to City Hall. There are seating areas and outdoor games and activities surrounding a central fountain. It can get crowded especially when the weather is nice so be aware if you're coming for a photo with the statues there may be a wait.

I took my daughter and niece and they loved the fountain. I think it is really cool that the kids are allowed to play in the water, it's even encouraged! There were games such as long pong (though there weren't any balls) giant connect four and bean bag toss. There are many really nice chairs to lay out on and a little table in between each set of chairs. It's so attractive there and I look forward to going back."

In the summer they also have a large foundation running & there is a small water feature area where water squirts up from holes in the ground at various times. parking is very limited though & you have to pay for it...no free parking."

What is beautiful is a statue of lüòçve spelled in huge letters where it gives the feeling a heart is placed where the O should be. also the way it is sculptured it is being held up a brass frame. If you are seeking your true love bring some pennies and toss them into the pond which is also in the park but watch out for the little children who are always dunking there feet and getting wet in the summertime.

The line moved quickly and if the people behind you are nice enough they will take your picture with your loved one. I guess the reason you come here is to find Love which I guess I did. Regardless we had fun and took great pics so it is all good.

There was also games and additional seating added. The park was changed to discourage the homeless population from living in the park which did not change. If anything it appeared as if the problem worsen since the underground area was removed and the additional seating provided space for those who live in the park an area to spread out. Regardless the park is still a must seen tourist spot to take pictures.

But the truth of the matter is this park is so disgusting. You can't sit on the walls because everywhere smells like urine and there are a lot of homeless people taking up the spots to sit and enjoy people watching on a beautiful day. if you ask me the money they put into that Park was a waste of money and it could have been used for the schools or something to give back to philadelphians. Because the city failed on Love Park.

Instead of the big old fountain made of concrete blocks, it's now in the ground with lights that's shoots up into the air like a sprinkler for the kids to run through and have fun. They have benches to sit on, and many sets of tables with chairs. Also, chairs for relaxing and in the one corner there's a couple ping pong tables for added fun. With the LOVE sign set in the front of the park, it's more welcoming to take a picture under it, and it never hurts to listen to some live music when artists come out to perform. This one was a good idea that followed thru!!"

When you realize the millions spent on things like Dilworth Plaza and soda tax; while the Concourse under City Hall, and SEPTA's main office are used as one big outhouse.
It should not be that way."

Gets a bit crowded but absolutely worth it. It's right down the street from the tree which is also another great site. All the shops closed down at about 8 so definitely give yourself some time to walk around.

Now they have a smaller fountain, not as spectacular. They have free ping pong tables with paddles and a ball! I played with my friends for some time! There is a lovely grass area, but they could stand to have more shade and trees for when it gets hot in the summer. The Christmas Village is also quite cute and authentic, though a bit pricey. Then of course there is the famous LOVE Statue where everyone wants to take a picture."

For the 11 months of the year this is barely a park. The fountain is rarely on due to faulty design. There is no shade at all so you are in direct sunlight. There are barely any comfortable places to sit. Their efforts trying to keep the homeless away in the end makes it feel like no one is invited to stay more than 5 minutes. The LOVE statueisn't even the most prominent part of the park now. Instead there is a huge parking lot sign, CAR PARK, that is next to it sticks out like a sore thumb.

Overall visit it in late November and December when it actually becomes a location to visit"

Lots of adorible picture opportunitys, live music, good shoping and a few infor spots to warm up and see diffrent festivities. I was last at love park when the ice skating rink was being built. Im more of a Penns Landing girl but ai have to say as far as location gos there was a lot more to do after leaveing! I love philly and all its culture!

Easily accessible by public transport (15th street station is stone throw away), opposite city hall and a beautiful 20 min walk from Art Musuem. There is usually a line for clicking a photo with the LOVE statue. The park itself transforms according to seasons and festivals. They have a small and cute Christmas Market in December and used to have a great fountain space in the summer. The construction is finally done at this place and tourists can enjoy a good view of the city. I wish there were more plants in this park, because it would add to the aesthetic and environmental value of this place. Besides getting a photo at the LOVE statue, there is nothing else to do here. However, near the park, there are multiple options for restaurants and bars within 15 min of walking distance."

Now that said some people need to be aware of others and show some consideration. I had my young niece with me (9 y.o.) and a man rudely pushed his way between us. When I said I'm with that child he gave me a dirty look and kept pushing through others. Luckily I was able to grab ahold of my niece again before she was swept away from me."

Unfortunately we hit a rainy, dreary Sunday afternoon but most of the vendors seemed festive and welcoming. There are plenty of spots to buy a meal or unique snack as well as handcrafted clothing and gift items - representing lots of cultures, especially Germany. It ends around 12/23 so be sure to plan a visit soon!"

Belgian fries, pretty much every vendor is amazing. Our last thing to do is to go back and get the cheese sandwich which has just been out of control since the place opened. We keep going back there after day and hope to get a shorter line. We did get a sausage with sauerkraut and mustard and it was awesome. Where do they get the bread? Definitely a fun time great gifts great fun great holiday spirit."

Hosts a variety of events throughout the year including the Christmas village. Try and go off normal busy hours because it can get very crowded.
12/08/2018 01:54:31,Joe Yatsky,112633632507872141292,4,"With the Christmas village set up around the park, it is actually quite a nice place to take a stroll and breaks you from the overwhelming grime of the city around you.  Without that...it does have the sign if you feel obliged to take a photo in the filthy lot"

A once world famous park became the center of boredom and lack of inspiration as there is not much to see besides plain concrete anymore. Even the city itself seems to be shy to show pictures of this mess as the only thing related to LOVE Park you see there is the famose LOVE sign."

Of course at one side you'll find the famous love statue with plenty of people taking pictures with it.

I'm not sure that there is really any reason to come to this park other than to see the love statue. The love statue was actually a lot smaller than I expected and was kind of anti-climatic."

It bums me out that the Powers That Be would rather literally raze the old Love Park just because some skaters realized it was perfectly designed (and some unhomed people found some respite there). Now it's basically broad flat concrete with barely any shade. Disappointing and frustrating use of millions of dollars

Icon ""LOVE"" sign is a must-take picture for all who has visited or visiting Philadelphia. Convenient located near city hall. A short walk to various nearby places (Chinatown, Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Art Museum, Reading Terminal). Occasional events helped to make the area more lively and better utilized the spaces."

LOVE has lost its luster here Not a single mention of the history of this Plaza and its connection to JFK and his relationship with Philadelphia. Those who approved and designed this New Love Park should feel disgraced by its failures on so many levels.

The sculpture is iconic, and representative of the city's nickname the City of Brotherly Love. The location is a great place to walk around with the City Hall being so close and Reading Terminal Market only a few blocks east of here, additionally the Philadelphia museum of Art is close and the ""Rocky"" steps. Great fun place to go snap some pictures and enjoy the city."

La¬†escultura LOVE, de la¬†plaza John F. Kennedy, es uno de los lugares preferidos para tomarse fotos, tanto por los turistas como quienes viven en Filadelfia.
Tan famosa es la estatua que la plaza es llamada com√∫nmente¬†‚ÄúLOVE Park‚Äù¬†y la mayor√≠a desconoce su verdadero nombre.
La plaza John F. Kennedy fue construida en 1965 sobre un estacionamiento subterr√°neo y luego fue ampliada con la adici√≥n de escalones de granito bellamente curvados y una majestuosa fuente.
La ic√≥nica¬†estatua AMOR¬†de Robert Indiana fue instalada reci√©n en 1776, durante los actos del bicentenario en 1976, pero dos a√±os m√°s tarde fue removida. Debido a su inmensa popularidad, la escultura regres√≥ tiempo m√°s tarde a la plaza en forma definitiva.
Aparte de ser¬†un buen lugar para tomar fotos, cerca de la escultura se ubica el Centro de Bienvenida Fairmount Park y una tienda de regalos."

One can definitely visit it if in downtown, but not worth making a separate trip of it."

It was a very pleasant time, with McDonald's-ified versions of many international treats like traditionallike french cr√™pes,  authentish d√∂ner kebabs, reheated belgee-I-wish-the-employee-working-the-stand-gave-a-flying-fig-an waffles (AKA liege-ish waffles), and hot $5 cocoa to wash it all down.

Even with the cheesy knock-off versions of the aforementioned foods, the market does offer legitimate German-made traditional Christmas items. Principal among them are the Weihnachtspyramide (Christmas pyramids with the vanes on top that spin if you light candles below), Schwibb√∂gen (hand-carved Christmas arches), and R√§uchermannl (wooden figures that appear to be smoking pipes when you burn an incense cone in their  bellies). Several of the event staff are actually German, and speak German, which is very refreshing to hear.

The park itself has undergone significant renovation, including removal of the fountain. I can't guarantee that you will not not be unaccosted by people who make this park tbeir semi-permanent residence, but go check it out anyway; it's worth a gander. Just don't go alone at night. It can get a wee bit less than comfortable if you're not used to dealing with the kids of folks you find out on the streets at times of day or  night, when those who are fortunate have homes are aldeady inside, battened down for the night. Just bring a few friends along, and you should have a fine time. :-)

Also, it's fun to go around the corner, & visot the giant clothes-pin. And don't drive, there's practically nowhere to park close by, unless you want to pay..."

Love Park, and the Love sign is synonymous with Philly, and is at center city near City Hall. It is such a gorgeous area and in the summer, it's also nice to sit on the side and dip your feet into the fountain. When the wind blows, the spray from the fountain blows on you and it feels amazing.

There are tons of what seem to be really nice people offering to take your photo for you, but just stand back and watch what happens after they seem to be so nice in doing so...they then demand money from the folks who just got their pic taken. Don't ask, or agree for strangers to take your pic. They want money. Take your own, it's cuter that way anyway!

It can be a sketchy place at night, so be sure to stick with the daytime visiting."

Currently, it's mostly just a concrete slab taking up a block. There appears to be a lack of  greenery, trees, seating, and architectural intrigue (outside of oddly-placed steps). The Love statue returned, but it just feels like it was plopped down near its original location."

Lots of vendors but to many choke points caused by the ongoing construction. It would have been better to do another year around city hall they use love park to early.

One of my first stops while in the City of Brotherly Love was of course the famous LOVE Park and it's Love Sign! The park is very mentally located to other tourist attraction live Independence Hall, Benjamin Franklin Museum, Franklin Square, etc. Definitely worth stopping by."

It should be back in place in September 2017. If you really want to see a LOVE sign, there is a replica (I'm guessing it's smaller, but I didn't get to see the real one) on the U Penn campus across from the Sweeten Alumni House."
