04/02/2024 02:09:10,Anwar Md Hossain,102007699294378549343,5,"Pleasant Hill Park is a delightful 35-acre waterfront green space located in the Torresdale section of Northeast Philadelphia. It’s a place where history and nature intertwine, with remnants of an early 20th-century fish hatchery offering a serene setting for relaxation and teaching children how to fish. The park boasts a playground, expansive lawns, riverside pathways, and a sports field, making it a versatile destination for outdoor activities. As part of the city’s Rebuild initiative, Pleasant Hill Park is set to receive improvements, ensuring it remains a cherished locale for community events, fishing, and enjoying the scenic views of the Delaware River."

Trash and over grown weeds. Could Definitely use lots of TLC to help brighten it up because it can be a beautiful place to relax and hang out with a little bit of care. It was a great place to watch the sun rise over the water.

This was our 4/5th time visiting this park. It hasn’t been packed or busy when we’ve gone so it’s like getting the park/playground to ourselves. Sometimes ice cream trucks come threw so bring some cash if you want a sweet treat.

There are bathrooms there but they are not the cleanest so bring those wet wipes and disinfectant out. But when you got to go you got to go.

The pond is nice to check out even if you aren’t fishing. The kids like to see the fish, frogs, and turtles. Beware of the geese though, they don’t seem to have fear of you and will come at you if you are in their space."

Seeing fish, turtles, snakes, frogs and ducks by the hatcheries. Children can fish there too! There is also a very nice and clean newer playground with a swing for special needs children along with regular size and baby sized. Plenty of seating and some tables/benches for picnics. It’s also very nice to see the River up close and walk along side it on the trail. Plenty of parking and the ice cream man is usually always there for those hot days. I would recommend to anyone."

Aside from stunning views of the Delaware River, there's a fish hatchery area that encourages novice fishermen to practice catch and release. The original historic hatchery building from 1914 is closed but still stands. The park is dog friendly, has a large, new playground, a boat launch and the biggest parking lot I've seen for a Philly park anywhere. We look forward to visiting again in the summer."

11/13/2020 19:32:00,Bret Lafty (BretL835),111567349734951730996,5,I have been to this place since the 70s . We called it the hatcheries.  It was always a place for kids under 16 they could fish there. There are about 6 seperate man made ponds that has small bass  some pretty big carp and Catfish. The other side is the Delaware river which has a boat ramp in the main section. You can also fish the river  from that side. The view which is basically the river attracts people to hang out and relax. This place is a staple in the Northeast some may call it Linden ave. Which is the name of the road that leads you back there. There is ball fields there also. There are firework displays during the holidays.

The fishing area and the water front view or some people use to go on their boats. The reason I’m giving it 4 star and not 5 is because some shady business going on with cars in the parking lot. But I mind my own business and generally feel safe. There’s a Big long slide which is fun for kids that like an extra thrill. There’s a 5+ section and a toddler slide play area. They Accomodate a swing for handicap and have baby swings Ofcourse. It also had a nice walking trail and a big field to play football , soccer , tennis , fly a kite etc."

09/10/2019 00:23:23,Wal .S,112332323741797367309,4,"A nice scenic  park with a breathtaking view of the Delaware River . It's  a great  place to hang out  with friends,family  ,and to also bring your children. They have  fishing ,a playground  for kids ,food ,drinks ,and a places to picnic. In addition  there is a boat ramp that makes  the Delaware River  readily  accessible, and ducks as well as Canada Geese.  The park was a little dirty  with cigarette butts ,litter and there are no Park Rangers, however  they do have surveillance  cameras  ,so just be mindful of your surroundings just in case . Aside for from these minor shortcomings, I would definitely recommend  visiting  Pleasant Hill Park in Philadelphia .  😁👍"

05/21/2019 22:54:03,R B,108437363913403943561,3,"Decent enough park. It has the waterfront, playgrounds even a hatchery for fishing. People bring their boats here to access the Delaware river. People like to bring their bikes here and do burnouts. Same for their cars. If you don't mind the noise you'll be okay. Gets less family friendly after sunset. There is a no alcohol policy but i doubt its enforced. I hardly see any park Rangers there. Scratch that. I've never seen any."

05/20/2019 19:47:02,Richard J. Barbalace,101144973039602474725,5,"My favourite childhood park, now even better with a fairly new and well maintained playground.  The playground has settings, slides, climbing rope tower, climbing play structures, and a cool worn sculpture smashing around its border that children enjoy clamboring on.  The park has a fish hatchery, catch and release fishing, girls, a small woods, the boat launch into the Delaware River, and good views of the ships in the river.  Careful climbing on the rocks on the river bank.  I like that they have allowed the edge to become more naturalized with bushes and more mature trees, and so do the ducks and geese that can now be seen there.  One of the best parks in the city.  Still, it needs a water fountain and proper restrooms by the playground."

Whether you're just hanging out, fishing, watching boats or need sometime to yourself, this is the place to enjoy during the nice days, spring into summer into fall. Winter time is boring but ya never know who you'll run into or what friends you'll make. Highly recommend a visit"

Can be nice, can be trashy. It depends on the weather, the amount of actual litter and how many people are there.
It's a nice walk through the fish hatchery, look for turtles, bullfrogs in the spring. There are also three huge, white swans that reside near the boat launch."

Enjoyed watching the children fishing with their parents .  Often drove by but never took the time to experience it .  One suggestion : there seemed to be a lot of cigarette butts on the ground, perhaps people don't know that there is No Smoking in public parks .  The signs did state this, along with the other 'do's and don't's', but signs for this purpose only may help .  One man was about to light up when I mentioned there is No Smoking in the Park, and he replied that he was far enough away from the playground to smoke ...   .  Otherwise, it was a wonderful time, long overdue !"
