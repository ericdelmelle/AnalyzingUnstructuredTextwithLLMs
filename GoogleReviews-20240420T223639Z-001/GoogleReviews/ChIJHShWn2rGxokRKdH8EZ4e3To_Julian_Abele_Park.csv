10/19/2021 18:32:05,Luke Sondergaard,102520574167486358626,"Sometimes it is simply nice to have a quiet favoured little place to retreat for some personal reflective time and this little park certainly ""meets the mark"". Nice to stroll in with a little snack, a book or just to sit and chill out, particularly on a warm summers day. Appreciated especially by those who favour a ""pet free"" environment, which in turn leads to an increased hygiene level. A perfect setting perhaps for older citizens in particular to gather and enjoy long hours of conversation about ""the good old days"" !",4
10/13/2021 17:46:22,Megan Wilcox,106253592949393170364,"Update:  it's randomly used!  I saw someone teaching children a class out here recently, it was fun to watch and I'm glad the parents have plenty of benches to sit on.

I walk by here frequently, but hardly ever see anyone using this park.  They have some nice benches, good plants and a great grassy area.  No dogs are allowed at all which is a shame and probably why it's never used.",5

The park does not allow dogs. There's a grassy area, a few plantings and a little free library box. We spotted a bench to sit and relax. This is a walk-to neighborhood park. Street parking available nearby is scarce.",4

They just got a major haul of some fresh trees and shrubs to help grow this into a true urban gem. Check it out, and if you get a craving for coffee, there is the amazing Ultimo a block away, and if you're feeling a bit friskier, there is the Sidecar Bar and Grill right across the street with some notoriously amazing burgers and always a great tap selection...added bonus: Sidecar also allows dogs on leash at their outdoor tables!",5
