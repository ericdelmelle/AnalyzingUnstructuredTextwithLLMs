It's got a playground, a dog park, a baseball field, workout equipment, benches, tables, and a nice path going around it. It's always full of lots of different people. I like to run or walk around the path and listen to music or talk to a friend. I would definitely recommend it.",5

We go at least 4 times a day with our pack!!  Come check us out!",5
