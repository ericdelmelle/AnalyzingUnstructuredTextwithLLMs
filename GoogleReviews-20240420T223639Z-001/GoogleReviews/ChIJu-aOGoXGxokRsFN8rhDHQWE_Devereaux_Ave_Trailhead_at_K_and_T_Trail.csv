It‚Äôs a part of the larger Schuylkill River Trail, offering a scenic route for walking, running, biking, or fishing. The trail passes through historic Bartram‚Äôs Garden, providing a unique blend of natural beauty and urban history. It‚Äôs maintained in partnership with the Schuylkill River Development Corporation and is a beloved green space for both locals and visitors."

As of 2022, the northern terminus is the Newkirk Monument but heading south the trail runs along Botanic Ave. to 51st St. and enters Bartram's Garden's meadow further continuing to a public plaza at 56th St. Beyond the SRT continues to 62nd St. on its way to the Passyunk Crescent, currently in planning. Trail is accessible via 51st St."

John Bartram plants and trees are over a  hundred years ago. I was raised in adjacent Bartram Village, which was public housing in the '60s and '70s."

There‚Äôs tons of parking that is free and easy access anywhere from the street location to the bars from Garden Center anywhere across the river line. This whole area was updated has lights and really cool nice calm bike trails which he can take his lead with the family you can fit 10 cars wide in some areas and I want to leave the savings. All I know is that you can definitely come here anytime of day and enjoy it while they‚Äôre open bike trails are open much later and run against the river you can see the train how many of the landscape areas and as far to the city. You can definitely have a great experience here and have a good time

It's a very nice surprise in the middle of a residential area.  Bartrams Gardens also has a great wedding venue!  Several old stone buildings with surrounded by grass and trees.  If it wasn't for the occasional road noise, you'd never know you were in the city!  They hosted a nice outdoor ceremony, followed by Hors D'oeuvres and drinks in an open area with tables.  Then dinner and reception in a huge tent with a wooden floor and decorated nice enough to make it feel like a hall.  Great place!"
