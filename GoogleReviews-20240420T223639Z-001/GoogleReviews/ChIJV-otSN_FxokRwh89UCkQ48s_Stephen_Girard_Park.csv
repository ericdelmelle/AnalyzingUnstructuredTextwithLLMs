It‚Äôs a green haven bounded by West Shunk, West Porter, 21st, and 22nd Streets, offering residents a peaceful retreat from urban life. The park stands on land that was once part of philanthropist Stephen Girard‚Äôs farming enterprise, reflecting the area‚Äôs historical roots. Today, it‚Äôs a community gathering space where locals enjoy the open air, engage in recreational activities, and participate in events that foster a strong sense of community.",5

The atmosphere is conducive to friendliness. Plays a crucial role in an area that is so lacking in green space.,4

Please be careful if you're bringing your dog. While these dogs that run free may be friendly, my dog can be fearful and reactive if approached suddenly. Stephen Girard Park is NOT a dog park, and according to Philadelphia law, all dogs in a public space should be on leash.

These laws were put in place for a reason.  As we are following the leash laws, we should have full access to the park, and not have to worry about other dogs approaching us. However, I'm finding that more often than not, we need to turn around and leave the park as there are too many dogs running free and we feel unsafe. :(",3

I have always loved working out at the park and looking at the house that Stephen Girard lived in. It is very clean and very safe, and recently they have redone all of the pavement around the park and they have done work inside the park to make it more spacious and beautiful.

I always make it a point to stop and look into the ""Leave a book-Take a book"" box right in the middle of the park. People seem to leave other  miscellaneous things there as well. I recently bought treats for my dog that he wouldn't eat, so I left them there. There is another little box in the middle of the park for people to leave unneeded plastic bags for those who are in need of them for   ""dog waste""bags. Most people do pick up after their dogs. It's a great place to go. It's always kept neat and clean by the person that lives in the house on the park as well",5
