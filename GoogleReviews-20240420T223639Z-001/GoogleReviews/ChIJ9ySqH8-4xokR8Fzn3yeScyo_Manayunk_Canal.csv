Note that connecting with the upper forbidden drive requires going up one of several long moderate road climbs. All are well paved except for lower Port Royal.",4

Trails are paved, unpaved and boardwalk, all along the canal. Beware, some do not have fenced barrier.
Interest,  quite a few murals with mosaic detail and bridges crossing over the canal.
The water not inviting. But the geese were having fun, also  nice to find a heron.
Worth Exploring!",4

09/27/2021 15:46:55,Ben Flexner,107240474954458986805,"The Manayunk Canal Path, or ""Tow Path"" as it's commonly called, is a great little path that connects the SRT between Shalmont Station and Kelly Drive at the Ridge Ave Transportation Center. The Tow Path is nice, but it's a combination of boardwalks, asphalt, and packed earth and as a result, the surfaces are pretty rough and varied. It's not great for riding a road bike on, but it's passable. You do have to be careful when running or walking, as there are some little holes and dips here and there and often puddles in the dirt sections of the Path. It also gets pretty tight in a few places, especially with all the cyclists and people fishing off the boardwalks closer to Manayunk. During the late summer and early fall it can be very buggy as well. That said, it breaks up the SRT nicely and it's still much better than trying to run or walk on the sidewalks of Manayunk, on Main Street.",4

05/18/2021 15:51:21,tori okorodudu,117213938341330408422,"I love walking this path with my friends! The pictures I've taken are further down the path, but depending on which direction you take you will either reach abandoned train tracks that lead over the Schuylkill River (a very nice view! I've put the pictures here although they were taken in Fall) or another path that is surrounded by greenery that eventually leads to a dam that overlooks the river (I've also put those pictures here)

There are many shops near this path on Main Street, but I wouldn't take too much food on the path with you unless you have a bag to carry it in because once you go deeper down the path there are not many trash cans.

I don't often cross the train tracks, there is an old dilapidated sign there that says ""No Trespassing"" so if you're concerned about that type of thing you can go on the tracks, take a picture and then leave. If you have more of a sense of adventure you can go down the tracks and find a route that leads to another path on the other side of the river. I wouldn't recommend taking small children here

The dam is harder to get to. When you get on the canal and face the water, you're going to want to turn right and continue walking down that path until you hear running water (or see it through the trees). From there you can cut through the woods and get to the dam. If you're walking the right way, you will eventually get to a bridge, don't cross it. Stay on the right side of the water and go under the bridge.

Overall a nice walk, especially since it's getting warmer now. You can also bring some bread because there are geese and ducks in the water. Sometimes they're with their babies, its so cute!",5

All uses - walking, running, strollers, bikes. Some folx sometimes fish off of the walkway. There are also really cool murals that have been commissioned along the route. It really is a gem

Multiple busses will drop you off on ridge ave. In roxborough,  or on main street, which is liberally 5 feet away, fish are here throughout the year. The types of fish here consist of freshwater predators, and also different bait fish.Hot spots are any where the flow of water hits a wall, under a bridge, and any small runoff drain or spill ways.",5
