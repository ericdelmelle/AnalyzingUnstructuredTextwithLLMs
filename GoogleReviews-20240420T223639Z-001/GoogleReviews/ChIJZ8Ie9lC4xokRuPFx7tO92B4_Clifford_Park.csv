The park is named after George Clifford Thomas, an investment banker and philanthropist whose 1869 mansion still stands within its bounds. Upon his death in 1907, Thomas‚Äôs estate was donated to Fairmount Park, enriching the city‚Äôs green spaces. Today, Clifford Park is a testament to Philadelphia‚Äôs dedication to preserving its historical landmarks while providing residents and visitors with a peaceful retreat into nature.",5

03/25/2018 20:48:07,Emily McCann,106684663638632309858,"This isn't a dog park, it's just some trails and a field where you can walk your leashed dog. There is no fence, and part of it runs along the very busy and dangerous Lincoln Drive. There's also a stream that runs thru it that has some kind of industrial pollution situation on-going-- it's bright orange and is staining anything nearby orange.",1

03/13/2018 20:42:54,Lo Mack,109840379908360775451,Nice area with wild grass and a few trails to walk your dog on. There's a nice half hour loop around the Thomas mansion. You pick the trail up from the field down the hill to the left.,5
