Plus the wonderful library is around the corner. Plus the sprayground makes the heat more bearable in the summer (not a ton of shade yet, the trees just need time to grow). The diversity is really strong, kids and families from lots of neighborhoods merge here so you can usually meet someone new while also seeing lots of regulars too. I love getting to hear 3+ languages when we're there. Since this is a haven for older kids as well as young ones, more protective parents of younger kids sometimes seem perturbed by pre-teens and teens being what I consider totally normal. Yes, I have smelled pot by the basketball court, yes kids sometimes swear and play-fight near my kid. Lots of moments for me to think how I will navigate raising my son in the city and teachable moments for him, but I consider that quite an opportunity. Wonderful spots for parents to sit and hang back while keeping an eye on your kid, so they can do their thing.",5
