Lots to keep the children occupied and happily burning up their youthful energy. Nice to stroll along the paths and relax on one of the many seats on the Square. Focal point covered pavillion for events and activities, especially useful during the long hot days of summer. Autumn sprinkles a carpet of leaves over the area bringing a different seasonal theme and sharper pre winter sunsets.",4
