04/02/2024 02:02:38,Anwar Md Hossain,102007699294378549343,"Cloverly Park, nestled between Wissahickon Avenue and School House Lane in Philadelphia, is a serene two-acre passive park that‚Äôs part of the city‚Äôs extensive public park system. The park was a generous gift to the city in 1914 from the Edward White Clark family, and it once formed part of the estate called Cloverly, as indicated by the stone wall and columns with the initial ‚ÄúC.‚Äù The family‚Äôs former home site, now the park, used to host concerts in its bandshell. Today, Cloverly Park is a peaceful retreat for residents, offering landscaped beauty and paved walking paths, maintaining its historical legacy while serving the community‚Äôs present-day needs.",5
