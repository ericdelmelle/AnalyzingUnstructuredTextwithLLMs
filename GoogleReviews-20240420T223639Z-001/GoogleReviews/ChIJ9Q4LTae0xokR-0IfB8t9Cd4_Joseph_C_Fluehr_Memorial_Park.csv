02/28/2024 20:04:47,Karissa Pelletier,110691699129604425889,"This is a really nice, paved park. Plenty of parking and clean. However, in the past 3 times I’ve been here, there are people with their dogs off leash. I walk with my two dogs, leashed, and this causes stress to both them and me as no one wants an off leash dog running up to them. It does not matter how “friendly” your dog is or how well trained it is, KEEP IT ON A LEASH. Not all dogs or people are dog friendly. I don’t know why it’s so hard for people to comprehend.",3
