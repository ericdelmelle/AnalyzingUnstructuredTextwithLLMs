There are several blocks of grassy expanse, the plantings are well tended, with benches and trash cans provided. There's a clear view of the Delaware River and the bridge walkway is an I95 overpass to reach Penns Landing. Getting a close look at Stroll, the 30 ft high stick figures sculpture by William King alone is worth the trip."

The bronze statue is stunning and a sight to be seen by those with Irish heritage and every person with an immigration story in their family tree. Both the Irish and American flags are maintained quarterly by charitable organizations and private contributors. A must see ceremony takes place each saint Patrick's day."
