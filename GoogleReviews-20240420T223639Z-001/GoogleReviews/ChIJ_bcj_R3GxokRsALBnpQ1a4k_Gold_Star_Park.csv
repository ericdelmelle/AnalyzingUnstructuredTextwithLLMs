10/26/2023 01:51:02,Caroline Nguyen,102165042126855740794,Found this place after going to pho75 with my 16 month old daughter. I've been to many parks around the city and I would say that this one is one of my favorites. The park has a field and a very nice play area of the kids. There are tables where you and sit and watch your kids play. I like this park cause its surrounded by houses and not near traffic in any kind of way. I always see parents hosting birthday parties here and its just nice overall. There is a dirt/sand pit filled with trucks and shovels for kids to play. Additionally there are bikes/toy cars for kids to play with.,5

Lots of climbing and slides for younger toddlers and older children. Place for children to ride bikes. Picnic tables and plenty of benches for parents. Grassy areas to put a blanket down to read books. Separate area to walk pets. Lots of trees shade the playground/sitting areas on those hot summer days. So glad we were introduced to this cool playground. My daughter's favorite playground",5

It's between 6th and 7th Street on Wharton in Philly.  On summer weekends people put up tables and sell crafts and collectibles.  Further into the park, there is playground equipment.  There's a kind of ""run"" around the park for bikes and scooters too.  And there is room for parties.  There are no bathrooms at all, and parking is hard to find.  Plan on walking a block or so to the park from the car.  Once you arrive at the park, it's accessible, although there are no benches.  Either bring your own chairs or plan to sit on the grass.  There is also no food for sale.  Nevertheless, it's an ideal park for a young person's party or even a romantic lunch (you brought), on the grass.",5
