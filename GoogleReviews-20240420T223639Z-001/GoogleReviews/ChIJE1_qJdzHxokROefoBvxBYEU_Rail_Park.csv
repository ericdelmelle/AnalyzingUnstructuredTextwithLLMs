Some people are up there eating, others are kids playing games on their phones..some are walking dogs or working out. It's just an eclectic vibe.  Everyone seems to mind their business for the most part... it's not crowded. I probably go there once a week due to Pokemon go.",5

09/07/2023 15:41:09,Dan Zena,116423619131223861708,"This park reminds me of a developing and mini ""High Line"" that you'll see in NYC. Its cool usage for an abandoned rail line and as of right now looks pretty cool. Nothing much too see as of yet but its a cool spot to explore or if you need some green space, some quiet from Center City. There are a lot of homeless that do hang around here but from my experience, they really just try to find some peace and quiet and never bothered anyone. This park looks cool and hopefully they continue to add more to it.

PROS:
-Cool concept
-Quiet, spacious, not far from the Center City/downtown area of Philly
-Sort of low key and never really packed (as of now)

CONS:
-I have seen homeless around here but never felt sketchy. The homeless I have seen here tend to visit here to be left alone and get some peace and quiet. Usually reading, napping, etc. But if this is a concern for you, just proceed cautiously.",3

The idea is brilliant- and even though it's much smaller than I had hoped for, it was still a Wonder and a pleasure to be on. But the area where the signs denote that it has come to an end for now, look like they've been there a very long time. If this park ever does come to full realization, like it's NYC counterpart it could become a wonderful way to travel from one section of the city to another while avoiding traffic and all the other street level nonsense. But until then, it's at least a pleasant little diversion.",4

I wish there was more shade as it's too hard to seat under hot summer sunlight in the daytime. Also, I guess there is not enough budget for maintenance and there are a lot of intoxicated homeless people, which creates a feeling of insecurity.",4

05/22/2023 00:55:23,Juliana,101048820604730490692,The Noble St entrance is not easily accessible from Broad St. Due to nearly building construction you have to walk through the middle of the street which does not feel safe. Overall it‚Äôs a good idea but it seriously needs funding for expansion. The signs say there is a plan for phase 2 but there was clearly no expansion construction happening. There seems to be a lot of dead space with wide walkways. I hope this expands in the future because it has potential to be great.,4

05/11/2023 21:49:10,Ray M,111562790250943162489,"Great opportunity to check out The Rail Park.
There are three phases to the park.  Only the smaller phase one is completed, situated near Broad Street, just off of Callowhill.
Once all phases are completed the park will extend from the Art museum area to Northern Liberties. Includes a total of 3 miles, covering 10 neighbourhoods and 50 city blocks!
This is a very exciting project that will provide a nice cultural addition to the city while keeping and sustaining green spaces, if possible.
The finding is provided by, Friends of the Rail Park, a nonprofit organisation. They are doing a great job in getting large and small corporations to support them.",5

- park is covered in gravel
- almost all of the park is at an incline and so is the seating on it
- most of the benches are either too low to comfortably switch to seating on from a wheelchair or the swing seats are too high to get into
- only one end of the park has an accessible entrance, most of which has been blocked off
- the sidewalk isn't accessible on the left hand side of the entrance,
on the right hand side you have to go into the street (they have after
several months marked this out with cones but entering from that
side also requires going all the way around the platform that blocks
most of the accessible entrance)
- wall mural about the history of the park is on the top of a platform
- there are some wooden paths, none of which are connected, most are too narrow for a wheel chair and tend to go no where
- plants are blocking/growing over most of the wooden paths",3

Getting to the park is easier on foot rather than trying to find street parking, but the entrances are a little hidden. Finding the stairs on Callowhill between 11th and 12th streets is easier. The Noble Street entrance is at grade, but you have to come in from Broad Street. I visited on a Friday late afternoon and the park was being used by families, solo walkers, dog walkers and a few hanging out and reading or taking on their phones. Lots of seating in sun or shade, interesting plants and a modern, industrial aesthetic which was expected, but not especially creative or unique. An NYC High Line knockoff for sure. I would have loved to see something more inherently Philly, more local. The park seems well cared for, though nowhere near as manicured as say Dilworth Park, but perhaps that is the point. The horticulture looks more like what the railway was in all it's abandoned glory. You can see what that was at the Callowhill end. Well worth a visit, walk out back and forth a couple times then sit and soak up the sounds of the city.",4

The concept is really cool. They took an old rail line and converted it into a park. Right now it's only a quarter of a mile long, but I read that they're going to make it 3 miles long eventually.

I hope as it expands they add a little more greenery and start to add some vendors to add more of an entertainment element like the Highline has. I also hope they preserve some of the original tracks because it's a nice element to integrate into the park.

There are two entrances right now ‚Äî one has stairs and the other end is handicap accessible. The swings at the beginning were a really cool touch.

I definitely think this is worth a quick visit as is and can definitely see it becoming more of a destination in the future.",4

When complete you‚Äôll be able to go from John Heinz Wildlife Park (South of the Airport) all the way up past the Wissahickon to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania! That‚Äôs one hell of a ride let alone walk so get started early!",5

08/05/2018 05:30:54,Frank Scarpato,106677656073293582773,Should b more like this but deeper in South n North Philly...But for where it's at on broad St n also opening before completely finishing the park it's not the greatest this rite now..Not even close.  Once it's finished it should be better.  Like adding that food on the train in the beginning of the rail because that's another thing to do while there..only other thing is to see the stones with every language and the copper map of the historical industrial part of Philly..,3

Not enough shade or larger trees or coverings. There was also only one trash can which could be a large problem in the future. It was very warm and we didnt stay for too long because of the lack of shade, but this is only the first part so hopefully they fix these issues in the future.",4

Located in the ""Loft District "" aka Philly's Gotham City, and touching Chinatown.
The elevated view of the city  isn't the best, but I can still find gratitude of the green space and chill out and relax.  Has the potential to be a dope park as the development continues.

The only drawback was the gravel/stone path.  It's not good for flipflops or sandals as others have posted here.  Maybe the designers will take these comments into consideration for phase 2 of the trail.,4

The future plans for the rest of the 'track' will be amazing based on this proof of concept. I'm excited to see the continued development of this area. Right now the surrounding neighborhood is a little sparse for dining and other options but I believe this will improve with continued development.,5

Climbing the steps from Callowhill Street to the park level above (no wheelchair access at east end), visitors encounter several massive bench swings suspended by metal rods.

Several dozen feet ahead, a look to the southwest affords a peek at the William Penn statue (Calder) atop City Hall.

Two walking surfaces run the length of the park during Phase I. White pebbles and substantial planking allow a choice between crunchy and smooth.

Plantings appear native and hardy.

Parking may be difficult. The walk from the eastern to western ends takes no more than 10 minutes. Allow more time if the thought is to people-watch.

No restroom facilities, water, or shade.",5

It's much better to look at than the eye sore abandoned wreck it was before. That said I hope they choose to go away from the gravel and pave the trail instead.
