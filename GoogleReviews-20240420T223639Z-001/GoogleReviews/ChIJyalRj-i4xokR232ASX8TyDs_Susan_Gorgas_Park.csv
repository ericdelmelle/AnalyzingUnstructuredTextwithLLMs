03/16/2024 23:01:29,Lori Patterson,102989627455189432931,"I love taking the little boy i watch there,but the one downside is when the high school kids hang out there and are all in the kids springs and other play apparatus. Plus they smoke and use foul language. I only go if I don't see them there.",4

10/22/2023 02:03:44,Jon ‚ÄúTraveler 369‚Äù Perez,116061207309705205498,"Beautiful, lushgreen park situated right on Ridge Ave between Hermitage & Fountain Sts. A playground designed specifically for the little one with plenty of swings & slides. Trees that provide plenty of shade & enough open space for a nice picnic or something like that.
The only drawback; the matted ground in the play area it a little worn but it still has its original buoyancy for safety. The Jungle Gym w/ metal slides at both ends is a bit dated & has an opening at the end that could present a challenge of falling off or out for the very young that are easily distracted. This is why I suggest if you have kids 3 & younger to be right there with them.
Overall it's a great place to take the kids, the pets or just yourself.",5

Fantastic slopes of green grass and fields for running and playing. A track nearby at a high school allows for structured running or walking. Used to take my son there often when we lived in Philadelphia.,5
09/24/2021 20:47:06,Ben Flexner,107240474954458986805,"I really like this park, but I mostly come here to use the track. The track is great for getting in a workout when you need some place that's flat and fast. That said, it can get crowded during the weekends and if the weather is really nice and people don't follow the rules (no bikes and no strollers) so you do have to be prepared to run on a very ""public"" track. If track etiquette is the kind of thing that makes you rage, don't come here, your head will explode. It's common to have walkers in Lane 1, large groups walking 4 lanes wide or people weaving between the lanes. You also end up dodging kids and sometimes even dogs (another rule, no dogs on the track) but at the end of the day this place is still a great community resource and it's wonderful to have year-round access to it. It also has lights for the fall and winter so you can still use it in the evenings.",3

I have it 4 stars instead of 5 only because when the teenagers use it as a hangout I'm ready to take my kids and leave.  Most times this does not happen though.  The park is at the top of a hill and there is usually a stiff breeze.  I recommend you bring a sweatshirt or something long sleeved if you get chilly easily.  That would include for your children too.,4

It's well maintained with wonderful landscaping thanks to John Boyce and his dedicated crew of long time volunteers.  Over the years I've watched this park change into the beautiful space that it is now.  The park often hosts fairs, movie nights, cook outs, bands and orchestras, holiday celebrations, farmers markets, beer gardens and car shows among other things.  There's also a new softball field and dog park in the works!  A wonderful place for the whole family!  Check out friends of Gorgas Park on Facebook for the seasonal schedule of events.",5
