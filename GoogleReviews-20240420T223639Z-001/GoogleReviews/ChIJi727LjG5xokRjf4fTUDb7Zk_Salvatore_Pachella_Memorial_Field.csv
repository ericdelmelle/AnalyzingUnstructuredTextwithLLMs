Not only is there absolutely no light inside, there are no doors on the stalls depriving you of ANY privacy. If you leave the door open for light, you are fully exposed to the world.

This park is huge. It has three baseball fields and some soccer nets with wide open spaces to picnic and lounge. It has access to the Wissahickon trails and even has a map so you can plan your route. There is a shaded area off the grass with picnic tables that looks like it can be booked/used for family gatherings. I would definitely come out here for a picnic or to just kick around a ball on a weekday evening.",4
