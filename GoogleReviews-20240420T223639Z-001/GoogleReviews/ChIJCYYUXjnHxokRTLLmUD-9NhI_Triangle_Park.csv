05/29/2021 23:29:04,Barb Hauck-Mah (barbhmphilly),116895998071761886932,"This small public park is tucked behind the homes on 54th street. It's fun to hunt for all the triangle-shaped features of Triangle park. There's a shady picnic shelter, a little library box,and a playground that looked pretty new. We watched kids on tricycles moving along the paved path.  No dogs are allowed and nearby parking, if available, is on the side streets.",4

03/08/2019 12:55:52,Keith Smith,117716344405494614059,"It is a cute little park with a picnic area and exercise stations. The play surface is rubberized and padded. The park was redeveloped a few years ago, and the workers did a good job. Triangle park is gated (locked at night!) and well-kept, as neighborhood parks go. I would like to see some shade at the exercise stations, as I have at some of the other neighborhood parks. Then it would be perfect.",4
