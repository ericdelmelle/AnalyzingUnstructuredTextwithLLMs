05/12/2022 18:26:07,J koerner,116030021278817536583,5,"This park tho small is bursting with huge personality.
Given how bustling philly is it's always a good idea to pause and  smell the roses.
Dogwoods and tulips break up the brickwork of the city and the independent artwork and sculptures add heart and warmth that some would forget while working.
It's dog friendly and kid friendly as well as conveniently located.
If you ever need some down time I encourage you to set step to this tiny yet much needed park."

Seats strategically placed to create a sense of privacy and yet community for visitors seeking a quiet time of solace. Natural greenery and trees subtly placed throughout to perfectly blend with and compliment the urban setting of this precious neighborhood retreat."

There are benches, trash cans and all-weather metal picnic tables. The Friends of this Park take great care of the plantings, and they welcome dog walkers. It is next to the Fleisher Art school. We've walked by wedding ceremonies, outdoor art classes and other happy celebrations here."
