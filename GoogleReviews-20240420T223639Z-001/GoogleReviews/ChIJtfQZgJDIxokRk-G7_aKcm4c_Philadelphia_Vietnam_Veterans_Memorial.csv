03/14/2024 10:31:45,Anwar Md Hossain,102007699294378549343,"The Philadelphia Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a poignant landmark honoring the 648 servicemen from Philadelphia who were killed in action or listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War. Dedicated in 1987 and located at Penn’s Landing, the memorial is designed as an amphitheater with the names of each soldier etched in granite on the south wall. It also features ten panels that depict scenes of the war, providing a narrative journey from the conflict’s beginning to the final rescue of Vietnamese refugees in 1975. The memorial separates the warrior from the war, focusing on the valor and sacrifice of these patriots, ensuring their place in history and reminding us that freedom has a flavor the protected will never know.",5

Night had already fallen and we literally stumbled upon this park as we headed toward the riverfront. I do not know if there is a designated entrance because it felt more like we simply crossed busy streets and empty sidewalks. We were not prepared for a memorial, especially one of this magnitude.
My father and my step-father both served during Vietnam. I remember going to Washington DC and seeing the wall for the first time. The emotional surge upon reaching the walled courtyard was much the same. I regret not knowing the area well enough to have had my first experience with the Philadelphia Vietnam Veterans Memorial in daylight.",3

The park itself is a bit run down and the park benches are not usable during the warmer months because it seems every bench is infested with bees. The park could use some TLC and maintenance but the memorials are well done and seem to be in good shape. The park is also a bit desolate so use caution when visiting.",4

05/25/2020 13:57:38,Barb Hauck-Mah (barbhmphilly),116895998071761886932,Our family visited Memorial Day weekend. The memorial honors the 648 service men and women killed during the Vietnam War. There is a separate memorial in Vietnamese thanking the soliders for their service. The beautifully landscaped installation is open 24/7 with some seating and adjacent to the Korean War Memorial. They are collecting donations (almost near their goal) to build a POW/MIA memorial here. Commemorative services are usually held here on Veterans and Memorial Days.,5
