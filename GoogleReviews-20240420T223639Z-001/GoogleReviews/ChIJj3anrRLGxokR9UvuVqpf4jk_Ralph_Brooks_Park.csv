It's a great experience to view the mural arts and community garden (if still there?) The basketball court used to be junk, now it was renovated and looks great. Small, but very community driven.

Also a very small kids play area with a few pieces of nicely designed , but requires a bit of skill-type of equipment to explore in the back, behind the basketball court...

My photos are mostly dated. But it's still nice to remember that things were there, and after gentrification took over the area.

I'm NOT SAYING anything about that topic btw, one way or the other. Simply a fellow neighbor who likes to enjoy reminiscing.",5

It is also about neighborhood focus, a place for folks to gather, socialise, enthuse and analyse every play, pitch and point scoring lob. Basketball played with skill is a thing of beauty, mazy dribbles, quick fire passing and those glorious angular shots resulting in that great ""kerplunk"" sound as the ball find its target. How poignant it is to see a ""Stop the Violence"" mural nearby emphasizing the need for young people to orientate towards places like this instead of the streets.",4
