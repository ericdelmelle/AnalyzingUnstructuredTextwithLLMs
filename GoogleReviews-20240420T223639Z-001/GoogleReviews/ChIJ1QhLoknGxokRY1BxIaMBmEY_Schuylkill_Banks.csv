This trail is perfect for a nice stroll,with someone special or walking your dog and a bike ride or even a picnic along side of the benches and it extends towards Fairmont Park trail. I can't stop  talking about this trail. I highly recommend.",5

You‚Äôll see people exercising from early morning to late at night. They have events during the summer like movie nights and you‚Äôll see groups of people hanging out and enjoying the evening time.

Not the entire length is lit up at night so you do have to be mindful about that. I would be nervous walking by myself and having dark corners here and there but that‚Äôs more a night thing than anything else.

When the river gets flooded parts get impacted but the city does a good job maintaining the length of the park and it‚Äôs a great way to get to Kelly drive and the art museum!",5

I will note for biker though - it can get extremely busy when it's really nice out, and at peak hours of the day.  I've seen several bikers fall off their bikes by hitting people or trying to avoid people.  It may not be the best place for bikes, but if you ride further past the art museum it is less crowded.",5

You can access the schuylkill river trail and bank all along the trail, but I live nearby Walnut and I usually hang around that area if I'm not walking the trail trying not to get run over by cyclists and plowed by runners; it's quite the adventure even just trying to cross the trail to sit on the banks...think Frogger! All jokes aside (though still do be careful) it is a worthwhile place to enjoy a little air and green space without leaving the city.",5

It‚Äôs not clearly signed from the city, so if you‚Äôre visiting Philadelphia your best bet is to walk to the nearest bridge crossing the Schuylkill, and keep your eyes peeled for steps leading down on the eastern bank. From there, chase it north into country that looks like more like Henley than anything in the USA.",5

I enjoyed visiting this place multiple times during my 5-day visit to Philly. Even though the river is dirty and appears brown the surrounding greenery makes up for it. The paved trail seems to stretch endlessly, making it an ideal spot for running, cycling, walking, or just hanging out with friends on a full moon night. Watching 4th of July fireworks from this location was amazing.
The city can get hot and sultry during summer but walking by the river on the trail and boardwalk is sure to help ease the discomfort.",5

This time I was on assignment from a meditation class at Shambhala Center. Take in mindful awareness as we walked in the urban environment. What happened was unexpected.

As I walked I was seeing and experiencing what was present, but at the same time I also experienced many layers of the past; times I ride with me son or walked with friends when various buildings were not yet in existence. Each step of the walk brought back different experiences, overlaying the past people and buildings that had been here on top of the people and buildings here now.

It felt like Philadelphia was opening like a flower whose petals were layered through time as I walked past. I almost didn't know which petal to look at; the ones that brought back memories of people I love and loved our the city as it is in this moment; in this present, which has more people and more cars and more buildings and is changing each second as I take each step along the river.",5

One of the gems of philly. There's stairs/ exits along the way the lead the other areas of the city. So you're not stuck on the path. My sister walks her dog here and they have all kinds of stops along the way especially for dogs to stop and get a sip of water. Very nice path to take a stroll. They've recently extended the path past the South Street bridge...even better.,5

Do the loop down Kelly Drive by Boathouse Row, the Art Museum, Waterworks Restaurant,  and a Skatepark. We stop to rest on a bench on the grass right in front of the Scuckill river, then take a stroll to watch dogs of all sizes play at the dogpark. On Sundays you can do yoga in a class on the grass (just bring a mat) We finish our ride back to the car up West River Drive which is lined with trees, and often stop on a lookout over the man - made fish bridge and dam on the river, where you can sometimes watch the college students race on rowboats past Boathouse Row in Regattas. Wear your Fitbit and bring a packed lunch, and you couldn't ask for a more relaxing and enjoyable day",5
