When I drive past the park, it is usually crowded on a daily basis with a diverse group of all ages and ethnicities.
I have utilized the basketball court for the past few months to play with my buddies on a weekly basis.
The basketball courts are poorly maintained. The baskets appear to have been built some 30 years ago by locals; the backboards are made of what appears to be plywood with a standard double-rim attached. The backboards are not attached well to the support, so bank-shots become a much different experience than usual. The courts need to be cleaned and repainted but the asphalt isn't in bad shape. The courts are covered in garbage: soda cans, bottle caps, pens, plastic bags...
There is usually a group of people smoking blunts but they don't bother anyone. There is a lot of interest in using the basketball courts, so it's confusing why they're so poorly maintained. The locals are really friendly who play basketball there, from really young kids to older men. Shout out to Todd and Nate Dogg. There is also a huge range of skills at any given time, from people in flip flops who appear to be throwing the ball at the backboard to kids that clearly play in leagues/for their school to people that used to play competitively.",3
