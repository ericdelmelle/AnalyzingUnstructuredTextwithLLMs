03/15/2024 20:44:33,Anwar Md Hossain,102007699294378549343,"Marconi Plaza is a historic urban park located in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Named after the Nobel Prize-winning inventor Guglielmo Marconi, the plaza serves as a cultural landmark, reflecting the area‚Äôs rich Italian-American heritage. Divided by Broad Street into east and west sections, the 19-acre park features Roman-styled architecture, including winding pathways, terraces, and reflecting pools. It has been a part of the city‚Äôs fabric since its creation in 1914 and was the grand pre-entrance for the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition. Today, Marconi Plaza is a cherished green space that hosts the annual Columbus Day Parade and provides residents with a serene setting for recreation and relaxation.",5

There are vulgar pictures drawn on the playground equipment on 15th street side that should of been cleaned up a long time ago. The grass is never cut in 15th street park. It could also use new playground equipment for the kids which I'm sure the City has plenty of money in their budget to provide. There used to be basketball nets on 13th street side but for some reason they were taken down years ago. There isn't much for the kids of our City to do to begin with so it would be nice to see the park be updated for them.,2

Cant go wrong here as it's one of the nicest parks to do a variety of activities in. Only downside is there are plenty of others that have a nice playground for the kids plus a splash park or misty area for them to cool down in the hot/humid summer heat.",5
