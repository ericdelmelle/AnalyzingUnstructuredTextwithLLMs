We had hotdogs, chips, water and hot chocolate, definitely was going smooth. While waiting for space in one of the bouncy houses we noticed that it was really crowded with large kids and smaller kids. There were two different bouncy houses one was a replica of a boxing ring, and had huge boxing gloves for the children to use on each other. Some of the older children took the boxing gloves and brought them over to the bouncy house that was not the boxing ring. We looked around for any adults that were supposed to be supervising the two separate bouncy houses, but there was no one around. I saw who I thought to be the head of the organization. I asked him if there was anyone to supervise the two activities and he told me YES but sadly they both we not around. He then proceeded to ask me if there was a problem, and I told him of the larger children mixed in with the smaller children and how they had brought the boxing gloves to the other bouncy house. He laughed and asked me did anyone get hurt yet? I told him no and that no worries if someone were to get hurt, I would laugh too. He kept talking as I turned my back on him and gave him a peace sign over my shoulder. He then said to his group of male friends that someone always wants to be negative, I never thought that having concern for children was something negative. He finally dispersed from his group of five other men to go find the two adults that were supposed to be watching the bouncy houses one of the men that was supposed to be supervising was part of the group of men he was speaking with ï¿¼and the female he claimed that was supposed to also be watching was over in the kitchen area socializing and mingling with other parents. I was completely irritated and was ready to start snapping but realize that neither him or his negative mindset was worth any more of my time or breath so I went over to Dollar General inside the Olney Plaza and brought him enough items to make three Easter baskets. ï¿¼Right before I left a little boy went up to him and said that he was accidentally kicked in the face, I guess someone did get hurt."
