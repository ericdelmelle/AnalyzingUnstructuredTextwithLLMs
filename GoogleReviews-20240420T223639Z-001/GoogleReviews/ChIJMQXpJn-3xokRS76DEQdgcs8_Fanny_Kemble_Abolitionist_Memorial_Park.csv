07/11/2023 02:42:44,Anna Smith,117939486224332412466,"This park is ok. On days when few people are around, the park is a great place to walk through if you stick to the paths. My main complaint is the absurd amount of animal feces left all over the edges of the park. It's disgusting, and every time it rains, the park smells HORRIBLE. When locals do visit the park, they play loud music, throw their trash everywhere, shout incessantly, etc. I've seen some people try to keep this place clean every month (God bless them), but this park really needs the locals to respect it so more folks can appreciate all the work put into the flowers and trees.",3

It's the annual Father's Day picnic in  Kimble Park.  Jim and Rita had a fantastic food layout as usual, and everything tasted good! My son, Harold Armin was there, with his son, Armon and also my nephew, Rahsaan.  Also, today is Juneteenth, honoring the memory of our ancestors.  Earlier, I had attended service at my church Miller Memorial Baptist Church, where we had a Juneteenth  Celebration, and sermon by visiting Pastor,  Rev. Dr. Vincent E. Stokes, ll.
