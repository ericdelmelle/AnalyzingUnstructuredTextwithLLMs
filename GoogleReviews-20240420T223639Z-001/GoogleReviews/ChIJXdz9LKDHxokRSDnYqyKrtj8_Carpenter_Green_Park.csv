It's small, but offers a lot of grass, some benches, and an area specifically for pets to go to the restroom.  On really nice days I see people out with chairs sitting in the sun or lounging in the grass.  Quite a few kids seem to hang out here after school on nice days and there are always a lot of pet parents.  It's my go to spot for getting dogs some grass to walk around in."
