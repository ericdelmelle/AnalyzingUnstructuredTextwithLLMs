I will say however if you have a special needs child or an eloper it can be scary as the gates to traffic is downright sad and the specialized equiptment swings necer have buckles. Theres also a.nice little nature hike to take overall a decent little park very scenic,4

Benches for lunch/picnics, huge field space where you can play dodgeball, baseball, football and more. Our favorite is badminton! I'm still undefeated. Haha Seriously, though, it's a great park!

04/21/2018 23:56:19,M Hasili,111224814879699355243,I absolutely love this playground for many reasons.  The number one reason is its Clean! When I first moved around here I was just looking for a playground for my then 2 year old but never expected to have found one that I actually liked. This playground is suitable for all ages and there are 3 playgrounds here with a sign on each one to seperate  the  ages. That's another factor that I loved. With having such a young child at the time and just starting to take him to  playgrounds there's always a fear of older kids running him right over but when I came here and saw that each  playground was for the best suitable age with the signs on each playground labeling them my mind was at ease. The only thing I dont like is rhe fact there is a big road next to it with a little fence. So if you have a child that likes to run just watch them closely. If you are looking for a clean playground environment where a lot of children go then I would definitely try Champions park playground out. It's by far the best playground around!,5
