04/02/2024 02:23:20,Anwar Md Hossain,102007699294378549343,"Pennypack on the Delaware is a picturesque park located along the Delaware River in Northeast Philadelphia. Spanning 65 acres, it‚Äôs a hidden gem behind the Curran-Fromhold prison in the Holmesburg neighborhood. The park is a part of the Northern Delaware Riverfront Greenway and is accessible by SEPTA Routes 84 and 70. It offers paved and natural trails that wind through grassy areas and lead to a forested section at the confluence of Pennypack Creek and the Delaware River. The park is a haven for wildlife, including many species of birds and even bald eagles, making it a perfect spot for nature enthusiasts and those seeking a peaceful escape from the urban bustle.",5

Closed times are wrong on maps also, says 11PM.   Was greeted by cops.   You make sure we're OUT on time- but open whenever you feel like it.",3

Depending on when you come and what time you come you can talk with people who photograph wild life or  fishermen. I do know their has been a bunch of people that know that their is a pair of bald eagle in this park and in early spring you could see their nest with one of the eagle protecting the nest while the other went and hunt. This place is small enough to enjoy a small hike and the park staff do a great job getting majority of the trash for private or public events.",5
