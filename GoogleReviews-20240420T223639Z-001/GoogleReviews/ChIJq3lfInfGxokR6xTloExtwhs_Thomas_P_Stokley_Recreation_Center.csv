Field usually has a team practicing or playing a game.  There is a park community building.  I'm not sure programs offered.  The are also basketball üèÄ courts. Little play area for children -.like swings. The Vare jr High is across the street.  Sadly my jr high is gone. Police üöî& fire üî• department are across from church ‚õ™Ô∏è. Sometime I sit and read a book üìó it's nice",4

There leadership needs to organize some community members to assist with the littering issue. There is plenty of free parking if your not within walking distance. I give the park a 3.5 stars out of 5. It can reach a 5 with better leadership & more community involvement. But it's definitely on the right track.,4

I went along with my nephew and son who are 2 and 3. The area of the park for their age group was small and very cramped with the amount of kids. There wasn‚Äôt much for them but 2 slides and a bouncy 3 seater. After 15minutes they were bored and playing with a tree. Lol great space but I wish it had more play equipment for children.,3
