The park is celebrated for its connection to Pennsylvania founder William Penn‚Äôs legendary 1683 treaty of peace with the Lenape tribe under an elm tree, symbolizing a commitment to friendship and coexistence. Today, the park offers a peaceful retreat with walking paths, shaded areas, and open spaces favored by dog walkers and picnickers. Visitors can enjoy unobstructed views of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and reflect on the area‚Äôs rich history, marked by a statue of William Penn and the enduring legacy of the Penn‚Äôs Creek Massacre of 1755. Penn Treaty Park stands as a testament to the city‚Äôs past and a cherished urban oasis for residents and visitors alike.",5

Walk your dog, climb rocks on the Delaware banks (you gotta go when there‚Äôs a full moon rising!), take in the history, gorgeous views of the Ben Franklin, amazing graffiti on neighboring buildings, running trail past the riverside Casino. Tons of picnic tables for gatherings.

Now, if you‚Äôre from the ‚Äòburbs, you might be startled to see some tents in the woods or mini alcohol bottles and other trash along the shore of the river. If so‚Ä¶just stay on the paths. I did say this was Philly! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5

The fence that blocks you from falling into the river theres one spot where it doesn't go all the way across which can be dangerous if you have young children. The playground area is okay if your child is able to go on everything without getting pushed around by other kids. I honestly wouldn't choose this as my first choice for bringing kids maybe to hang with friends or something or go for a bike ride would be most ideal.,3

Every time I visit this park it reminds me of Franklin Park in Boston and Central Park in NY. Except that Penn Treaty is a lot smaller, of course. However; there is one problem that I have noticed, and that's the illegal mountain bikes and 4 wheelers that I have seen cruising through the walkways. These young people are usually showing off and they can hurt somebody. That's the only reason I didn't give the park a 5 star review. Like I said, the park is beautiful and it's getting better all the time and the people are a mix of all races and backgrounds. It's a great place to have a relaxing time with your wife, girlfriend, husband, or partner. I have visited this place for many years and I have never had an argument with anybody, but I have met some wonderful people and made some good friends.
There is one thing I must warn about. There's no bathroom anywhere in the park. You must walk to the Sugar House Casino to use their facility. If you do come, I hope you have a great time.",4

Young kids on mountain bikes were invading the park doing wheelies and putting children in danger. A park ranger was there but he didn't do or say anything. In one of those wheelies the young man fell down in front of the park ranger. He got back on the bike after almost killing himself and a little further as he rode off, he had to make a quick stop because a small toddler was running away from his mother. This is dangerous and the park rangers should put a stop to this. Lots of families attend this park from all walks of life. It's a great place to make new friends and have a peaceful and relaxing time. People from all walks of life visit this park. There's always something different to see and enjoy. Visit the park and you'll see that I'm right. Parking is the only thing that can ruin your visit. Only about 15-20 cars fit inside the parking. You can't park on the right side of the street or you'll get a ticket. However; there are a few spots after the park.  However; this blend needs to be addressed asap, because Spring is here and Summer is around the corner.",3

There are abandoned buildings in sight but also new apartment buildings and the Rivers casino. Nice views of the Ben Franklin Bridge. The playground looked a little boring and could use a facelift.

I went during winter so the grass wasn't too green and lush and the trees were bare. I can only image it looks much better in Spring/Summer.

The view of the river and the Ben Franklin Bridge are gorgeous. Just watch out for all the disgusting trash along the rivers edge. Keep your dogs on the path too, theres a lot of broken glass along the rocks. The parking lot is oddly shaped and very tiny, larger cars are better off parking on the street. All in all it's cute for a quick visit but not some place to hang for a while.",3

It can get very crowded in the warmer months.  Sometimes you have to contend with people that insist on riding motorized bikes or small motorcycles in the park.  There is very little security or police presence and they generally look the other way anyway.  Parking in the summer months can be limited and difficult as well.  The park is better during the work week, early mornings and during the fall/winter months.  Development is encroaching on the park which is a blessing and a curse.  There were ramblings about Live Nation Events getting involved with the park which I am vehemently against!",4

Rittenhouse Square üåç but I feel like I'm starting to like both of them equally it's a lot of room to walk around we can put your blanket on the ground or on the grass rather and relax you can also bring a hammock if you have one and tie it between two trees or you can walk the trail or just stare at the water and look at the sky and reminisce on where you want to be in the world or just reflect on life well to boil it all down it's a great place to go.

07/12/2020 16:34:16,lizbrownsays,108568640289000959468,"Penn Treaty is one of my morning go to spots. Avoid on weekends if you're trying to remain socially distant. Go on week days or early mornings. When the park first opens up it's usually pretty laid back with lots of space to run, cycle, or workout on the grass. As the day progresses the park fills in and gets a little overcrowded. The new updates along the waterfront provide a lot more options for those looking to find a quiet spot to meditate in the mornings. I recommend being careful along the rocky areas along the water because there are a ton of rats that roam around if you look closely you'll see them! Aside from the rats, this park is great. There are some beautiful views along the path and there is a spot at the back where you could probably launch a kayak or sup if you go early enough to do so, just note that this is not publicly listed as a launch spot.",4

Whether you're looking for a shady space to sit and be, or you want some sun and a view of the Ben Franklin over the Delaware River, it's worth visiting this 7-acre greenspace. In the shaded area is a relatively new playground good for maybe 30 children and a few benches and picnic tables near the fountain. If you want to sit elsewhere and you're bringing a group, bring blankets or chairs.

My family and I sat on the rocks for maybe 30 minutes and we were happy to chat and listen to some music. It was such a peaceful place .",4

They recently added a new path from the park to the casino and the construction looks good. The park has always been a great place for sunrises and sunsets on the Delaware river. It's a great place for photography too especially in the winter when the river freezes over. The playground is pretty new. It's definitely one of the better public playgrounds in the entire area. There area paths for walking and biking and a large field for other activities. Penn treaty park is great for friends and family or a nice place to get some peace especially in the early morning hours. There are benches and tables for picnicking and family gatherings. The only thing this place lacks consistently is a public bathroom, there are plenty of times when you will find a porta potty or two but sometimes the potties are gone so be sure to use the restroom before coming to the park.",5

There is a small parking lot and spots available on the street. There is a large field, plenty of tables with benches, regular benches and a decent size playground. The also has a large number of trees, considering where it is, that shade a decent amount of the park including the playground. The park does have an area directly on the river that has a few nice views. The park is under construction at this time (late May 2019) but does seem to be nearing completion.",5

It's very relaxing to bring a blanket, chairs and snacks and just sit and enjoy the park. Just be careful where you choose to sit, there is one or two squirrels that are not afraid to come very close if you have food. I love feeding and watching the ducks here.***Only dislike is this isn't a dog park, I'm a dog person but believe dogs belong on leashes in public parks. People allow their dogs to run free off leash and it's unfair to other park goers especially small children that are afraid and people in general who have a fear of dogs. Not only do they let them run free but several times I've seen them neglect to clean up behind their dog. Everyone should be able to enjoy the park peacefully without someone's dog running across their blanket.",4

06/03/2016 15:22:07,Erin Laughlin,108560117810934705723,"From Penn Treaty Park, you have an amazing view of the Ben Franklin Bridge. The park has a playground and plenty of room to run on grass. It's not the nicest park in Philly, nor is it very large, but it's worth it for the views. My biggest issue with the park is not the homeless people you may spot on a bench, but the fact that dog owners like to let their dogs off leash in this park even though there is no fenced in dog park, which is illegal. As the owner of an older dog who has gotten more selective with his friend choices, this particularly bothers me as I don't like having strange unleashed dogs run up on us. However, if you're visiting Philly, I really do recommend stopping for the view. It's the perfect spot for a photo of the Ben Franklin Bridge.",4
