10/24/2023 13:48:54,Rebecca M.,108898304767439726736,5,"I've been here a couple times and every time it's been quiet and peaceful, not too crowded like some other waterfront areas in the city. People come here to fish, ride bikes, walk, and use the skate park. It's pretty easy to get here from West Philly - I like walking across the Grays Ferry Ave bridge for a cool skyline view and then taking the trail to the 34th st bridge to get back into University City."

The park is part of the Schuylikill Banks project, and will one day connect the lower Schuylkill River to the rest of the Schuylkill River Trail. This modern park features a skate park, fishing access, and a pier that lets you walk out above the water for an amazing view of the city skyline.  You can also get down to the river‚Äôs edge and gaze across the water to The Woodlands Cemetery."

Highlights include a skate park and a new walkout fishing pier. There is a paved flat trail, with river and city views. There are some benches and trash cans along the way. The start of the Cresent Trail section is popular for fishing. You can find free street parking in the Grays Ferry neighborhood if you want to start the trail from here. We discovered that the Innovation Center ( where we planned to park) is closed to visitors/parking on the weekend."

A section of the Schuylkill River Trail also meanders through the site and will eventually connect to the new swing bridge and Bartram's Mile to the south and the Christian to Crescent bridge to the north. Features views of 18th c. Woodlands estate, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, the Mill Creek Sewer and a skate park underneath Grays Ferry Ave. Bridge. Entrances at Trolleyworks and 34th St."

I do wish people would follow the leash laws though. Since it has a little less traffic than the upper trail, people like to unleash their dogs and let them run. If you visit, please leash your dog - it is safe for everyone and it is also respectful for people and other dogs who do not like dogs!"
