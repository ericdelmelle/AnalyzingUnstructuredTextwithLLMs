07/21/2022 03:09:44,True Review,111806279891210626636,"Konrad Square is a small park in Fishtown. It’s a beautiful green space. It’s a nice place to sit and relax or read, have a picnic, take a walk or walk your dog. It’s cleaner these days. However, never forget why it was dedicated to Joseph Konrad, he was a firefighter who died fighting a fire in the neighborhood.",5

Thoughtfully planned with its paths converging on the greenery filled circular centre piece. The positive phycological value of trees to citizens in an inner city setting cannot be underestimated and is a welcome addition here. What a nice gesture to name this tranquil place after a fallen firefighter and hopefully it will be well maintained in honour of his memory.",4
