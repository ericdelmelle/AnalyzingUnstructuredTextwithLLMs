04/02/2024 02:10:42,Anwar Md Hossain,102007699294378549343,5,"Burholme Park is a public park in the Burholme neighborhood of Philadelphia, steeped in history and community significance. The park, along with the Robert W. Ryerss Museum and Library, was bequeathed to the city by the last descendant of the Ryerss family, prominent Philadelphians. The estate, which includes the Ryerss Mansion built in 1859, was opened to the public on May 14, 1910, after Mary Reed Ryerss fulfilled her late husband’s wish to leave the land and much of his estate to the “People of Philadelphia, forever” as a museum and public lending library. Today, Burholme Park provides fields for sports organizations, including baseball diamonds, a football field, and soccer fields. It also contains a playground and is a popular sledding spot during winter. The park’s large hill and open spaces make it a beloved area for recreation and community events."

I like to let my dog off of the leash because she is an extremely anxious dog. Off the leash is the only time I see her just carefree. I love that, but maybe it's time for them to enact a leash rule. I'd rather she be hindered and safe than free and in danger."

They also have a pretty nice miniature golf setup. The park is the place to be whenever it snows because they have the best Hill in the northeast for kids & adults to sled down. There are picnic areas in the park as well as a football & baseball field. There is parking around and inside the park.

05/13/2018 00:45:54,Wal .S,112332323741797367309,3,"A nice 85 acre  park with a commodious amount of space for a multitude of different activities   . You can play various sports here  such as football ,baseball, soccer etc . They also have shaded areas  where you can eat at . It also is an ideal place to go jogging  and they have an appreciable  amount of tree and plants . In addition  they have a large historical museum on the premises  .The kids seem to really like sledding  here is the winter whenever there is any substantial  snowfall,  since there is a small hill located in the park.

I would would actually  give  this place four stars if it wasn't  for all of the inconsiderate ,ignorant ,uncouth , and indolent people  that don't  clean up their dog waste when they walk their dogs here despite the signs that say their is a $300 fine for not cleaning up after there dog .These signs is of course seldom to never enforced  by the law which  is truly a shame . I also think that the park needs considerably  more maintainence . They should also plant more trees since some of them were uprooted  and killed  by the inclement  weather  from the winter ."

Also has a few picnic tables scattered about which might be nice to use in the summertime.

There's a playground that has two sections; one geared towards older kids 5+ and an area for younger kids ages 2-5.

The playground features a lot of climbing equipment and several plastic slides along with swings. One feature I thought pretty unique was a percussion  area with a pair of drums and a musical xylophone type instrument.

There is also one swing that features a seat that can be used for special needs kids (ie cerebral palsy).

There is also a a baseball field and nearby is the Burholme Family Fun Center - An indoor entertainment center and an outdoor miniature golf course. I only drove by those two areas, but I plan to check out the Fun Center in the future."
