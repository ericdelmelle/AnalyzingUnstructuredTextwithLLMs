09/03/2022 16:32:24,Oliver Yu,106613853044500471932,5,Best public courts in Philadelphia! Courts are located along Chamounix drive with fences. The whole area is surrounded by trees and grass.

My husband and I have been going to the Strawberry Mansion courts for years, but I think we're making the switch to Chamonix. Shady, you're separated from each other, parking is right there (so you don't have to park in the grass like at SM). Two thumbs up!"

Spending time with the family & exercise-pals on the court, early in the morning, before the extreme heat attacks, is great! We love it!"

07/05/2020 16:06:06,ryan rendick,105070903483297797714,4,The courts themselves are ok.  There is not a lot of room behind the baseline if you get put on defense in points. The court surface is older hardcourt but no cracks. Courts play at average speed. Many courts are in the shade which is an absolute bonus. Can't beat it on a hot day. Friends of chamounix does a good job helping maintain the grounds.

09/04/2019 14:12:05,John Rose,106748084801427416443,5,"The courts and nets are in nice shape by public court standards. Two of the courts are out of commission, and several others have some cracks but are playable. Overall, I have not seen a shortage of playable courts even on Sunday mornings.

What's really nice, compared to a lot of public courts, is that most of the courts are at least partially shaded. During those blazing hot summer days it's nice to be able to play in the shade!

Additionally the courts are (properly) situated more or less north-south instead of east-west. So you are not looking directly into the sun during mornings/evenings.

Each court has its own fence so you don't have to worry about disrupting (or being disrupted by) errant balls from adjacent courts.

Plenty of parking. There are also public bathrooms, but they always seem to be locked. Not sure what the deal is there."

Trees will give ample shade to take rest in a sunny day. I wished some kind of wall to be there so that I could practice alone too.
