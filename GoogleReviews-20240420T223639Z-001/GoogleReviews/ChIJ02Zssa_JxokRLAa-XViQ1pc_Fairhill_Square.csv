Tree lined perimeter and green spaces between converging paths with seating. Colourful adventure playground suitable for children from approximately age three up to around ten years old. An interesting ""El Gran Teatro de la Luna"" (The Huge Theatre of the Moon) feature provides opportunities for outdoor drama, cultural and musical activities. Overall a much appreciated neighbourhood space utilized throughout all seasons of the year."
