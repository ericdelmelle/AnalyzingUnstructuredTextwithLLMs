04/02/2024 02:19:52,Anwar Md Hossain,102007699294378549343,"Dickinson Square Park is a historic and vibrant green space located in the Pennsport neighborhood of South Philadelphia. Named after John Dickinson, a Founding Father of the United States, the park occupies an entire city block between 4th & 3rd Street / Tasker & Morris Street. It‚Äôs a place where community members gather to enjoy basketball courts, swing sets, jungle gym equipment, and the shade of large trees spread across its 3 acres. The park stands on the site of the former Pascal Iron Works and was transformed into a public park that opened in 1900. Today, Dickinson Square Park continues to serve as a safe, comfortable, and pleasing open space in a densely populated area, hosting an outdoor, producer-only farmers‚Äô market and various community events.",5

There was a cheese box, monkey bars, a slide, swings and a spray pad for us little ones, and a bocce court where the retired Italian masons would gather on Saturday mornings to play and (discretely) drink cheap jug wine from their tiny paisano glasses.

It's a nice park, especially for kids with the giant playground and the basketball court. There's plenty of space to spread out a blanket, but unfortunately today we realized the trees do a lot of sap dripping this time of year. It felt like a light spritz of rain every now and again to sit under a tree. We were back behind the basketball court, if that matters. No public restrooms it seemed - there is some kind of building in the center but it didn't appear to have bathrooms. Thought that was odd considering all the families who held birthday parties there but perhaps someone lived close by and the families just used their bathrooms. There also aren't too many places to lock up a bike that we noticed.

If you get hungry and need some food for your picnic, Gooey Looie's close by has amazing sandwiches (cash only, but there is an ATM there).",4

We visted with our dog on a weekend and every part of the block-sized park was in use. Kids were on the playground, lots of leashed dogs exercising, families hanging out on the grass and benches. There's a stunning block-long Mural Arts mural across the street. There were community garden beds waiting to be planted in the spring. I don't know if the castle-like building is open to the public.The park grounds were well-maintained and everything was in good repair. We've heard that the Mummers do concerts here seasonally, and will have to come back.",5

Having this park with such friendly people and kids where he can climb and interact is a God send!

That's kind of sad but it is what it is you always see kids playing people out there having barbecues people playing volleyball since it's right there in the neighborhood is not a lot of traffic around you can have some pretty quiet moments there,4

08/06/2016 06:26:28,katie meizinger hendrix,117500683221096775415,I love this park. It is amazing place to be and gives you a chance to do alive with people in the surrounding neighborhood. A good place for activities involving the kids. It is also dog friendly. But please I beg of you if you are walking your dog in the park please be curious enough to pick up after your dog. Either you can bring your own bag or u can use one of the bags located at each entrance.,3

There is no fenced dog park, despite rumours of one for years, but it's still a nice place to walk the dog, as the park is clean. While I don't have children, the playground appears to be modern and popular with the neighborhood children. Dogs and children alike are usually well supervised, but I do occasionally encounter children on the loose... I mean dogs. But seriously, dogs off leash is an occasional problem here, like most other parks.",5
