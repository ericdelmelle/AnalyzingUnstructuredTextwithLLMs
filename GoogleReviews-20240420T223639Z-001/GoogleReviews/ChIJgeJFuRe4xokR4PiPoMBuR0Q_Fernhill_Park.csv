Located at 333 W Abbottsford Ave, the park is managed by the Philadelphia Parks Department and provides a tranquil retreat with open spaces for the community to enjoy. It features playground equipment, adult fitness equipment, picnic tables, and benches, making it an ideal spot for family outings and community gatherings. The park‚Äôs history dates back to its donation by George John Warren (Lord Vernon) and its opening on September 20, 1858, reflecting Philadelphia‚Äôs commitment to creating green spaces for public enjoyment.",5
