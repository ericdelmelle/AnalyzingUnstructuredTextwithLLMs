The spacious bench also works well for individuals who wish to grab a coffee from Ultimo or food from Side Car and eat outside.  It is two short blocks from the larger neighborhood park (Julian Able) and only one block from the new playground at Chester Arthur school.

The park has beautifully festive holiday lights over the winter holidays."
