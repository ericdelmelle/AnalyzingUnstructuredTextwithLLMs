Parking isn't too much of a hassle as spots are often opening up on the parkway, however if you can avoid driving down and either walking or using Septa it may save having to drive around until something opens up..

I asked them 2 questions about the city and they did not know the answer)  and Loaded with Center City Workers (3) who you should directed any questions too, one of them will know the answer. But there's two to many and their a ""Waste of tax Payer Dollars!"" But  whats important is your toddler will ""LOVE IT!"" Every month they have different events happening for the kids and in the summer for the Adults a Thursday night free concert series. There's a small Cafe very clean and good staff with a small bathroom that's now free to the public. This is an updated review. My last review I really hated this place but they have improved everything here. For a toddler park I'm gonna give it 5 stars. WTG Sisters City Park. Keep up with the improvements. Another thing the Franklin Institute, Drexel's Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Free Library, Swann Fountain and The Barnes Foundation are all in the square.",5
