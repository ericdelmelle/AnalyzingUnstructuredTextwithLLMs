This park had some of the most dangerous sidewalks I‚Äôve ever walked on and I‚Äôve been to a lot of our country‚Äôs city parks. The amount of glass and trash at and around this park is sad. The sidewalks are not maintained and the paths are littered with debris. Please fix this.

Es un lugar hermoso donde se pueden disfrutar de distintas actividades como senderismo, ciclismo, paseos en bote, visitas a museos, conciertos y eventos culturales. Adem√°s, cuenta con √°reas verdes, lagos y jardines bien cuidados que son ideales para hacer picnic o simplemente relajarse.

Uno de los mayores atractivos del Fairmount Park es el Philadelphia Museum of Art, famoso por la escalera que aparece en la pel√≠cula Rocky. Tambi√©n se encuentran el Please Touch Museum, el Horticultural Center, el Shofuso Japanese House and Garden, el Boathouse Row y el Mann Center for the Performing Arts.

Otra cosa que me encant√≥ del parque fueron las diversas opciones de senderos para caminar y hacer ejercicio. Se pueden encontrar rutas cortas y largas para todos los niveles de condici√≥n f√≠sica. La vista de la ciudad desde algunos puntos del parque es impresionante.

En general, es un lugar ideal para pasar un d√≠a al aire libre en Filadelfia. Lo recomiendo mucho para todas las edades y gustos."

Being by the water and under the trees is a good way to cool off during the summertime.

I just came to relax in one section of the park. There is soooo much more to see out here than what I posted. Fairmount Park is huge and has lots of other great features and activities you can do here."

Police visit often enough to make you feel safe but not to the point where you feel like you are being watched. You will see nature at its best as deer and other wildlife literally roam freely and are actually eating food that they are supposed to eat. You know you won't catch a squirrel eating chicken bones or a bird using the plastic of a 6 pack for nesting. I have seen people even camp out with children to give them the experience of outdoor camping all night. People walk their dogs often here as well as there is a ton of room for them to run and be free... overall depending on your activity you will have a great time. Only issue I have noticed is that even though the park is full of Porter potty systems they are always locked. More for show then actually being used but they do come and changed them out daily which makes a clean place to potty if open and necessary.

About 65 years ago, when I got old enough to walk more than a block my dad told me that wherever I am in the world I should be able to point to my home. When I was about 6 years old, me and several daring friends decided to take a journey to Fairmount Park. We were all very young probably in about the first grade and we were having quite a bit of fun. At one point we decided to play hide and go seek. Well I wound up totally lost and no one seemed to be able to find me. After pouting over my fear of being lost, I remembered what my dad said. So I stopped, thought about it and then pointed in a direction I believed my house was. And I began to walk in that direction. I had to cross the train tracks and as I was crossing I saw a train coming l. I didn't want to wait for the freight train to pass, so I ran hard as I could and I made it safely or unsafely however you might see that in your mind's eye, to the other side of the tracks.  And then after a few more adventures I made my way to the edge of the park. Then I walked about about another mile and a half till I reach my house. At that point I was very proud of myself. On that day the planet shrank.
I have many fond memories of Fairmount Park, the entire park."

06/29/2020 19:23:05,Michael M,111824683576411939020,4,"I went shortly after dusk as night quickly descended upon the city of brotherly love and all 9,200 acreas of this expansive urban park - the largest in our nation! #themoreyouknow The illuminated cityscapes were very impressive perspective reach out, touch tease and twist the tips (pardon: tops) of both Comcast buildings. Admittedly the low lighting favors any lighted skyline appreciation opposed to any snature galavants.

From what I could discern Fairmount Park is STUNNING.  Maybe the cloak of darkness deceived me  - Just like a good dimmer and a few candles transform dire boardings before a critical lover, parent or caseworker pulls up on you and your abode. Nonetheless I can use my imagination and visualize this green spaces‚Äôs full potential - and it‚Äôs glorious on a ‚Äòrevolutionary‚Äô level.

Worth mentioning that I was shocked at the number of slow moving - speed limit abiding -  auto cruising (read: perhaps crusin‚Äô) along the curvy and hilly roads throughout the park. Those not in motion were parked hastily like they ran out of gas‚Ä¶ But everybody‚Äôs got their headlights on.  I am no na√Øvet√© Nancy so I snap judge that my fellow pm park attendees i‚Äôm not care as arbor aficionados - I‚Äôd argue that many of these cars are engaging in hanky-panky or even consumption of reefer!

I mean why else would anyone be out in park after dark, doing god knows what/who in a section of the city that has had its criminal challenges?

Or am I the last to learn where Philly gets it poppin on the low?"

Our seats were good enough for me to see, nobody was standing in front of us, and I like that they now have people walking around selling beverages, so you don't have to stand in long lines and miss the show. The acoustics were ok, it was easy to hear everything and it made for a great experience. I've been going to The Dell for years, and even worked there one summer. Things are much better now."

A place I've grown up in and around ( the water works) is very beautiful all year long. The only issue I take are the bikers. They fly around all the pedestrians walking ringing their bells causing people to jump out of their shoes. Just for the few hours that I was there the other day I seen a number of children almost run over by a number of adult bikers...these bikers in this city have been entitled by the city officials complying with all demands from bikers. These bikers requestspace to ride their bikes they want to act like cars and ride in the center lane otherwise, but when it comes to stop signs and red lights they just disregardwhat they want to be considered ""vehicles"".... annoying."

Parking surprisingly was free and we were able to get close to the venue, which was marked with section signs. That's a plus because when leaving it will be crowded and having that will help you easily find your car. The entry process was a little chaotic at first but once the employees guided everyone thru the cattle shoots it was simple. Take note, you can't take any water or food inside the music center and they do security checks of bags/purses.  O worries though because they have concession stands with water, beer, water ice, fries, etc. The seating was good and relatively comfortable, with good views of the stage. And the acoustics were awesome throughout the center and throughout the park. This was my first experience at the Dell Music  center and I throughly enjoyed myself. I attended the Lady B Basement Party which is old school hip hop was off the chain! The show was about 4hrs+ well worth the money. I will be back."

If you are visiting philly this is also where the famous Rocky steps are at the Art Museum and there is a statue of Rocky at the foot of the steps. If you are into art I have never personally gone into the museum but my sister in law did and she said the $20 she paid was worth it. It gave her access to the museum 2 days in a row which from my understanding to see everything you need a full 2 days.

They keep the place nice and clean. They have guided tours so you don't miss anything. The Museum is very large and they filmed the Rocky movies in that vicinity. Those steps take about 10 minutes to walk up but you end up getting plenty of excerise. I have been there several times but i still enjoy going there.

We paid $140 for the permit. It had no electricity, and water or bathrooms so I was disappointed we had to pay for the permit.
The gazebo is a little run down, with Staples all over it, be careful. The floor of the gazebo was covered with mulch. The nice thing was no matter how hot it was if you sat inside the gazebo it was a few degrees cooler and the breeze was refreshing."

The crew houses are right by East Fairmount Park, and have awesome lights year round. I do not have rights to the picture of the crew houses that are posted in this review. I posted them because I can never get a picture of all of them when I am there at night. The owner of the crew house picture has watermarked his picture, and gets all credit for that picture. The picture of the water without houses, I did take when I was there. I've never gone there during the day, but I like to take dates to this park and walk around at night. It is gorgeous and is a great place to walk and take in the views of the water."

She did, don't get me wrong. But walking around and trying out some of the larger and sturdier equipment, we started having more fun than a lot of the kids that were at that playground. We're definitely not the type of people that would ever dabble in recreational drugs, and though I know the opioid crisis is multifaceted and that there is not a one stroke solution to the problem,I think the city of Philadelphia how to try putting more playgrounds like this all around the city. Totally uninfluenced by any drugs or alcohol, we were screaming, hooting and hollering with how much fun we are having just playing at the playground. I'm convinced if we had more playgrounds like this all around the city with both large and small equipment sturdy enough to hold large adults then we would see a great many problems that currently plague our city greatly diminished overnight!"

Looked nice from the car, but an absolute nightmare to visit."

All donations. They have rented areas for birthdays but down side no adult beverages. But their is a huge field right outside the park which is completely fenced no one way in one way out. They have bathroom/ chAnging diaper and different areas for all age kids. Highly recommend on a early spring sunday. It can get crowded but it is huge wit a lot of FREE parking could it be any easier!!!"

The price of admissions at $12 per adult was prohibitive, especially since you could have seen almost everything from the outside. Not sure if there's anything interesting inside.

Truly the city's outdoor gem, there's plenty to do amid the splendid landscape. Whether you wish to lounge in a hammock or go for a brisk run, there's a spot for you to enjoy the parks awesomeness. Or maybe you like tennis, or frisbee golf, or biking, or riding horses. Again, tons to do! And so very scenic, especially in autumn with the light."

Being in the vicinity of the Art Museum, Kelly Drive, and the Ben Franklin Parkway is my favorite area in the city. Truth be told, parking has become increasingly more challenging, and I don't visit as much as I'd like to. It seems like the times that used to be ""off peak"" for parking are always high priority. With construction going on, they've limited spots by the Water Works. On this particular day, we took some relatives from out of town on a tour of some Philly sights. They were setting up for the Made in America concert so they couldn't really explore the famous steps where Rocky ran. The line to take a picture with Rocky was too long for our relatives so I'm sure we'll have to revisit another time."

Lots of events for all ages and plenty of food vendors to choose from. The entertainment was as culturally diverse as the food. Kudos to all who sponsored this festival for all to enjoy. This was a great family oriented event.

Plenty parking up and down the Kelly Drive or just park near Lemon Hill and walk down. Parking also behind the Art Museum but it's 2 hour parking. It's a great place to take your children and let them play around, while parents cool out or just take in the city skyline view. I love this park. I frequent it often. Just a great place to be. Relax your mind."
