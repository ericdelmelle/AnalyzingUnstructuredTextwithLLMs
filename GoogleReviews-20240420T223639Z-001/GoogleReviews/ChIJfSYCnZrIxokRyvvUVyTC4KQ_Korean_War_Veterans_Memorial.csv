The park features the Philadelphia Korean War Memorial, which was initially dedicated on June 22, 2002, and rededicated in 2007 after further enhancements1. It includes four 16-foot tall granite columns, each representing a year of the conflict, and six granite monoliths that provide information about the war, including major units, specific events, and battles. The memorial also showcases a bronze statue titled ‚ÄúThe Final Farewell‚Äù and is the site of annual Veterans Day and Memorial Day services, honoring those who served and sacrificed.",5

Such a cool area of town to literally walk through history. My doodle and I had our morning stroll and found our way here at the Korean Veterans Memorial Park. This is across the street from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Park. Smaller in footprint but equally beautiful and we'll put together.

The memorial itself is attractive and well done but the park itself, Foglietta Plaza, is a bit run down and desolate in some areas. The benches are in need of some TLC and the structure that possibly has bathrooms is probably not the safest. Very few tourists come through, except on holidays, and there is currently massive construction going on next door at the hotel. Street parking is available around the memorial with some 2-hour parking and some metered parking. If you are unfamiliar with the area, get the app and make sure your parking payment is current. Philadelphia is notorious for giving parking tickets.",4

For anyone visiting Philadelphia or residents when you are in the area, I recommend a visit. I think the Korean War and Korean War Veterans kind of get lost between WWII and the Vietnam War. It's good to reflect and remember our history and pay tribute to the men and women who served in Korea, and honor those who lost their lives.",5
