Place was loaded with kids running around having a great time after 5 pm. Lots of benches for parents to sit on. They have a single tennis court which isn’t in great shape with a giant crack across the court. There is also a fully booked tennis reservation, which from the looks of it gets hostile with people crossing out other peoples names and writing their own if anyone over books. Reservations start at Sunday so get their early if you want a spot for the week.",5

The two small boys 3-6  I take here don’t seem to be interested in playing here for long amounts of time so I feel like it may be lacking in play equipment. It’s a clean quiet park. Could use some updates or some added things for younger kids.,4

The place surfaces that soft rubbery material that will keep kids from getting injured, and in this park it’s thick and in really good shape. Same can be said for the actual play ground equipment, it’s quite new, in really good condition. So today was the tennis court, then that is in good shape, the service is pretty clean. Nice landscaping, plenty of trees for shade, it’s a nice neighborhood.￼",5
