Footpaths draw visitors to a central area with a circular bricked feature with greenery to delight the eyes and sooth the senses. Especially nice during the summer months. Seats strategically and thoughtfully positioned to encourage social interaction with fellow citizens. A fine and simple example of how vital retreats like this are to modern humanity with the often tense living conditions it has created for itself !
