Gate that closes. Two slides, 4 swings (2 baby swings). Walkable distance from the art museum and the sculpture garden. Crosswalks abound. There are some woodsy dog walking trails and a bridge overlooking train tracks…great for little ones who love choo-choos.
Cons: ambiance and traffic on all sides but 1.  It’s very small…10 kids here would make it feel very crowded. It’s also not near any restrooms or restaurants.

So not a bad playground, just not that memorable or amazing.",3
