11/17/2018 12:45:13,Truism F,105351619992720943366,"Too many abandoned cars left on adjacent streets.. Needs more police attention.. Truly this park is a dangerous place! What use to be ball fields, is now overgrown with trees and bushes. (Providing crime a place to hide and wait). One walk through this place and you won't feel safe. Decades ago, there were Fairmount Park Guard stations (and horses) patrolling this section of Tacony park. Today, they $pend taxpayer money on a new walking trail, under Roosevelt Blvd, that is clear danger to public u$e.. I would think you would agree they spent taxpayer's money on a ""bridge to nowhere"" here. A forensic audit of taxpayer money spent, would reveal one of many such boondoggles in Philadelphia.",2
