Donated by George Woodward, a prominent physician and developer, the park has been a nature oasis for nearly a century. It‚Äôs named after Francis Daniel Pastorius, an early German settler and founder of Germantown. The park‚Äôs current design, completed in 1935, was the work of landscape architect Frederick W.G. Peck. Known for its pond, walking paths, and large stage area, Pastorius Park is also famous for its summer concerts, a tradition since 1949, making it the longest-running free outdoor concert series in Philadelphia. Friends of Pastorius Park actively work to restore and maintain the park‚Äôs habitats, waterways, and structures, ensuring it remains a cherished community space.",5

The lights above the stage are white and bright and attract many mosquitoes. The performers kept mentioning the bugs too. Replacing the lights with yellow ones that don't attract bugs would help. The stage is right next to the fountain which makes noise. Might be better to turn off the fountain during the concerts if that's possible. There's no light and no walkways, so after the concert it's tricky not to trip over tree roots. Bring a flashlight. Toilets are challenging to use and there's no soap. If it wasn't for the free concert I would have given it 1 star.",3

02/08/2022 18:36:31,Michael Stirpe,109790084455256523829,"This is a cute park.  Several shaded benches.  A small man made pond in the middle with a tiny creek leading into it.  The pond looks a bit stagnant though and would benefit from more water flow.  The only downside to this park is that many people treat it like a dog park and disregard the leash laws.  There are signs at every entrance stating dogs must be kept on leashes, but people just ignore it.  It's pretty disrespectful of everyone else in the park, pets and owners alike.  I walk dogs as part of my income and anytime I go to this park I need to be on high alert.  Regardless of how nice the dog I'm walking might be I shouldn't have to worry about random unleashed dogs walking over and forcing an unwanted interaction.  It's dangerous, selfish, and frankly just extremely entitled.",4

01/27/2022 13:19:02,Hannah Marie,108437817852751732297,"Its a beautiful little park, with plenty of spots for picnics or hammocks, but I get annoyed by it being taken advantage of by dog owners. I bring my dog there a lot (leashed) and there are always off leash dogs, sometimes a dozen or so, running all over the place, jumping up on you. It's not meant to be an off leash dog park, but that's what people have turned it into. Good luck if you have an unfriendly dog or are just trying to enjoy a peaceful picnic. At quieter times, I try to let my dog off leash in a more secluded corner of the park to throw a ball for him. He won't run up to other dogs or people and bother them, but we can almost never do this as there's always off leash, badly trained dogs taking up every corner of the place.",3

We stop here with our dog on leash and do a few loops around every so often. The awful thing about this park is that people seem to think it is a ‚Äúdog park‚Äù. All the off leash dogs make the the experience here terrible. It clearly says on many signs that dogs should be leashed at all times. We walk our dog on a leash and the number of dogs who come up to us without human supervision is insane. Our dog is very dog friendly, but nervous in new situations. I know there is nothing that can be done to change peoples behaviors about leashing their dogs at this park, but just be aware of the rude people who don‚Äôt leash their dogs.",3
