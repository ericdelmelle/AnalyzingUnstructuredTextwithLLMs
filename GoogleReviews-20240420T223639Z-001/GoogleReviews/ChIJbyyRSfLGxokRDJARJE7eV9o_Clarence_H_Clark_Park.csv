The park complements the surrounding area very well and brings an extra bit of community to a neighborhood that might have otherwise been consumed by West Philly Colleges. Minus a star, however, for the homeless. Most of the time they mind their business and everythings alright. However, I and several folks I know have had bad experiences on multiple occasions from excessive panhandling to harassment. It's a tough situation... not everyone who makes a home in that park is bad, but the few that are really make it feel like an unsafe spot when all the usual fanfair goes away."

While the dog didn't seem ferocious...an owner can't expect all people are okay with that and need to do better. I thought I hear that maybe a dog park section would be added to the park but who knows if that's true or when that would happen.

Otherwise, great park to visit. I generally only visit the side of the park with the ""bowl"" and the toddler and older kid play structures. There's also a basketball court which is usually occupied esp on nicer days and a lot of people come here with to relax, bring blankets/chairs/snacks, family and dogs. There are some benches and picnic tables around, usually a farmers market Saturdays on the Baltimore Ave side of the park.
Lots of free street parking, there's a bathroom but it's locked most times I go. Luckily the nearby college may allow bathroom usage. Lots of activities take place at this park: check out their Web site or social media groups"

It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air of nature in the middle of the city, and beautiful year-round. Saturday markets are a joy and the dogbowl is so fun to just lay a blanket and read or chill with your friends and doggie watch. The food trucks are so good too! I love Tabachoy (Filipino food, Thursdays I believe) and the ice cream truck that makes it‚Äôs way around in the summer months. Highly recommend, especially walking up Baltimore afterwards and seeing the local shops and vibrant neighborhood ü´∂üèºüå≥üè°üå≥üè°üå≥ü´∂üèº"

I had ordered a platter that included Jerk chicken, rice and peas, corn bread and cabbage. The gentleman offered a vegetarian offer of Buffalo cauliflower. The serving size was hefty and I ate the food in the park with food left for later. The playground was full of children and there is plenty of greenery. This was a great Saturday in Clark Park."

If you want a quiet place to go, this might not be the place. It was full of life. Many different types of people were at the park.  I would for sure return, but not if I'm looking for a quiet place to chill. This is more of a hangout/meet up place.

Took a star off due to the very strong smell of dog urine throughout the entire park. People were also smoking weed and it was a tad bit rowdy."

It frequently serves as a staging ground for festivities and markets, as well as a relaxing green space to unwind.  It is easily accessible by SEPTA trolley routes 34, 13, 11, and as of writing 36. Street parking is first come first serve and unmetered in many locations. It seems well kept and clean, and is patroned by all ages and walks of life.

As a history buff I would love to see some kind informational exhibit devoted to the history of the Saterlee Hospital here that served the Gettysburg wounded, but one can dream.

Be sure to use the restroom before you go (there is no public one), but Green Line Cafe and Clarkville seem to accommodate people."

Located near neighborhood restaurants and caf√©s, and often a host for local food trucks, so food is easy to find nearby. No public restrooms that I know of.

There's a farmer's market every Saturday in the summer and fall. Locals often gather to pay chess, bocce, or volleyball.

One side of the park runs along Baltimore Ave so there's easy transit access via the trolleys. There's also a Indego bike share station on one side of the park."

Not only is it a good chill out spot in the spring and summer seasons; It's appealing even in the colder months. I recently was here and caught the end part of a community  farmer's market. I had enough time to purchase a homemade apple pie.

Pros
-The groceries were very fresh and local.
-The farmers and other customers were very friendly and helpful.

Cons
-One con is that there are no bathrooms so please make sure you have already gone before.
-Be careful of the unleashed dogs if you are bringing a dog that needs personal space.

Overall, I would go for the Farmer‚Äôs market. I recommend going earlier to avoid the large crowds. Remember to use bathroom first."

At 62 I've been going there since I was a child, and used to take my children as babies for their daily walks and play time. My grandchildren also went there to play. From going to the Friday Night Movie, or shopping at the various Flea Markets, to experienceing the Woodland Ave Reunion, to shopping at the Farmers Market on Saturdays where you can also learn a easy, low cost recipe and  they will give you Farmers Market Dollars to purchase fresh produce and baked goods, & eggs and butter.

On the other side Chester avenue, they have the deep bowl where they have concerts during the summer, and show movies, and that's where we used to play football. West Philly has got it going on!"

04/20/2021 01:03:09,Imani Davis,102554923669339216888,5,I really enjoy going to Clark Park! We went on a Saturday afternoon and there were a group of children playing with foam swords that meet every Saturday. Great space for the children to run and play. There is also a playground and dog park. Enough space for social distancing. There are usually food trucks and vendors. Farmer's market on Saturdays as well. Great place for a picnic or to relax with a book. Always a great time.

The park spans 2 streets with a busy road in-between. There's a section with tables, park benches, sculptures and paved walkways. There was a flea market and some picnics going on when we were there. The other part of the park is called a dog park, but it is a big grassy rolling area where dogs run off leash, with no enclosure. Off to the side was a playground and basketball court. We admired the ornate shed (see photo), wondering if that was a program space in normal times. The park is close to Woodlands Cemetery in West Philly. Free street parking is possible but you have to hunt and we didn't see any trash cans or restrooms on site."

03/22/2021 20:29:09,Nadia Lighty,112363345813239497658,4,There are 2 parks separated by a busy street. The parks are clean and spacious enough for walking and gathering while social distancing. The only down side is that dogs are also walked in both parks making it hard to have small children run freely without fear of exciting a dog. Most dogs are leashed but some dog owners do not adhere to this social etiquette that keeps humans and dogs safe. It's still a nice park regardless.

11/19/2020 02:39:48,MissMoMoney TV,103137801959902285813,5,It's too crowded... Only because of the covid..I don't think it should be that many people in one area. Plus it's only one machine for the whole produce market and I have bad knees and a bad back. I can't keep going back and forth for my fries and veggies.. It's too much of a Hassel especially for the elderly or physically challenged..ijsü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A nice area to gather with other avid dog lovers. Surrounding the depression is lovely open area for a picnic. Also, a perfect meeting ground for social activities. On certain Saturday's, the have a huge flea market type bazaar too! All in all, whatever you're looking for in an outing you'll find here. Except maybe public restrooms. There are local businesses in the immediate vicinity. Starbuck is 2 blocks from here heading south then east, and a restaurant on Baltimore ave, to the north of the park."

Signs remind visitors that it's a smoke free park and to observe pandemic precautions.  Food trucks and the Saturday farmer's market have returned.  Things get a little close when the chess games get heated with the onlookers crowding.  The homeless staying in the park seem to stick to themselves and clean up when they leave. The park isn't technically patrolled by the security forces or police but there is a nearby presence should the need arise

Tightrope Walkers just practicing for no particular reason. And a beautiful diversity of people from all cultures just getting along. Some are dressed in traditional cultural garb and it's a beautiful beautiful thing to behold. They also have flea markets there and they're awesome to go to 1 Durham place. Every single Saturday they have an Amish market there and it is awesome. I highly recommend this place very kid friendly

Every Saturday there's a farmers market until 2pm, and in the summer there's also a flee market during this time.

Theres also a dog bowl, a playground, a basketball court, and chess tables.

walking around d the entire perimeter of the park takes around 10 - 20 minutes."

As far as just wanting to get away from the city and take in some nature, it's okay. Decent play area for kids, enough benches to just have a seat. Not spectacular, but it definitely is way better as a park than a parking lot"

They have playground equipment for all ages, a wide empty retention pond for your furry friend, and benches for weary legs. There aren't any grills at the park, so if it's cooking you want to do, you might want to go elsewhere. There's ample amounts of street parking. Sometimes during the day, nearby schools will empty out at the park. Theres rarely a shortage of kids there, which is great if your child needs socializing. I would recommend this park to anyone in West Philly."

Plenty to space for kids to run around, there's a kids ""capture the flag"" game every weekend. There are public tables and chairs in a large gravel circle next to Baltimore avenue, people eat, drink and hang out there. There's a farmer's market every Saturday, with produce and goods from local farms and producers.

The other side of Clark park, across Chester Ave has 2 kids playgrounds and swing sets. There's the dog bowl where dogs seem to run free at times, which also hosts kids soccer games. There's also a basketball court closer to USP.

There's also a busy schedule of events on the board's, a couple of highlights are the Clark Park fair - the flea market, Shakespeare in the park and local food trucks."

It is a great place to sit, relax and people-watch. The only downside is the difficulty in finding parking. If you are able to walk long distances, you will be fine. However, as a disabled woman, I can only go to the park if I can park very close, and there are no handicapped spaces in the area (there is one, but the road it's on is often closed for the farmer's market)."
