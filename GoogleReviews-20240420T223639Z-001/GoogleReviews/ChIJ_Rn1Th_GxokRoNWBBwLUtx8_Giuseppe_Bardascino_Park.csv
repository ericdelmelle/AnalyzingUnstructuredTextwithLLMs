Yet amidst the concrete scene, not a speck of green is found.
Though bocce ball might bring some cheer,
Its crashing sounds are all you hear,
A mix of fun and slight dismay, in concrete bounds we're found to play."
11/23/2023 13:36:53,Michael Prosmushkin,106686481705111898421,5,Nice quiet and clean park with lunch table area and place for players. Beautifully lit at night.

07/04/2022 23:59:07,Heather,104291226617208985448,4,Tiny park. Parking is challenging (on street parking only.) Nice bocce court but there's only one so you may have to wait your turn. Nice benches while you wait.

04/28/2022 22:12:22,Cynthia Heider,110251054263355032334,5,"So delighted to have this lovely, vibrant, well-maintained park in my neighborhood. As many others have mentioned, there is a bocce court which supports both public and league play. Well-shaded (even sheltered somewhat from the rain) and a great place to stroll, people-watch, or relax and sip a beverage from the adjacent Function Coffee Labs cafe. Note: the park does not contain trash receptacles; plan to ""pack in, pack out."""

09/22/2021 21:18:58,Luke Sondergaard,102520574167486358626,4,"Just stroll in, take a seat and chill out. This is a slightly more unusual park, its openness and sense of relaxed informality entices folks from the neighbourhood to enjoy a quiet space from the hurriedness of daily life. The patches of greenery and trees thoughtfully situated throughout its relatively small area creates a breezy cooling ambiance, especially in the heat of summer. Perfect for organised community events, meeting up with friends for a chat or just resting and watching the world pass by !"

Friendly community gathering spot to watch World Cup soccer and enjoy neighborhood celebrations year-round. It's dog friendly and family friendly with a coffee shop, church and community garden nearby. This is a carry in/out park. They organize seasonal family activities, like the milkjug lantern craft during the winter, and community photo exhibit in the spring."
