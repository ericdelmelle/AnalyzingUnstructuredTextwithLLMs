Very peaceful and not busy. Just wish it was maybe larger and had more things.",4

It appears this park is run by people who live near it. Didn't know it was a private park? The name fits, Karen.. Certain people are allowed to use it, they can even throw parties. I wondered why in a diverse neighborhood ðŸ¤” I barely saw people of color frequent this small park.. now I know. I made the mistake to sit around with my son without realizing we weren't welcome.",1
