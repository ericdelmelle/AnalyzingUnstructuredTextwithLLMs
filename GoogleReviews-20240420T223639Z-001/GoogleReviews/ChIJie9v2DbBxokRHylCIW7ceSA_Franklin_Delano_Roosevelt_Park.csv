Hectic when there is a game though because everyone parks there and walks over to the stadium. Makes it hard for those that are trying to enjoy the park and can't find a spot to park or have to wait in long queues to leave since it's one way traffic. New areas being developed however seems to take a while.,3

The large structure in some of the photos was originally built as a boathouse in 1916 and was used as the Russian Pavilion for the Sesquicentennial 1926 Exposition. The gazebo (also pictured) named the Olmsted Overlook sits on the edge of the lake and provides such a serene setting in the park. Like the Boathouse, the gazebo dates back to the 1900s. The park is beautiful, lots of free parking, and so many cute places for kids to play.",5

Una de las principales atracciones del Parque FDR es el lago, que es ideal para paseos en bote y pesca. Adem√°s, cuenta con una piscina p√∫blica y numerosas pistas de tenis, baloncesto y voleibol.

El parque tambi√©n es muy popular entre los ciclistas, corredores y caminantes gracias a sus senderos para bicicletas y caminatas de diferentes niveles de dificultad. Los amantes de la naturaleza disfrutan con las √°reas verdes y la diversidad de flora y fauna.

Uno de los aspectos m√°s destacados del Parque FDR son sus instalaciones para picnic y barbacoa, perfectas para compartir un d√≠a al aire libre en familia o con amigos. Tambi√©n cuenta con una zona de juegos infantiles con variadas atracciones.

El parque FDR es un destino notable si visitas Filadelfia. Es un oasis en medio de la ciudad, con much√≠simas opciones para disfrutar de la naturaleza y actividades al aire libre. Definitivamente recomiendo un paseo por este hermoso parque a todos los que visiten Filadelfia.",5

There are several lakes there that are connected underground to the Delaware River, so all kinds of fish occur in them, I've even seen thread herring and even blue crabs come out of them- many miles from the ocean and even a nice distance from the Delaware River. There's also many kinds of plants and animals there, including deer. Picnic tables and a skateboard park too.
Although there WAS a golf course here, it has been closed for about 3 years now,  (at least, as of October, 2021). There are public restrooms though.
I just heard, (my wife read online), that the city is going to put a food court there and start charging for parking. as part of it's improvement plan for the park. I hope not! The local people have been enjoying the park since at least since my father was a child, (I'm 61), because it is quiet and undeveloped- and in all that time I, for one, never had to pay to enjoy the one green place near us!

Update: the Philadelphia Flower Show was held here last year and it is being held here again this year, might be permanent! What used to be the golf course is now a ""nature trail."" They have events for kids now at the old clubhouse and dogs are allowed in the expanse of the ex-golfcourse. They have also planted permanent flower patches, with small signs naming what is planted in them; some of the trees have identifying tags too. The boat house is renting boats again too!
They're really putting a lot of work into the park; just keep it free please- like it has always been my whole life - and long before.",4

Upon entering the area outside the show, it was a little confusing what to do and where to proceed in order to enter the park itself. Nothing a few well placed signs wouldn't correct. Upon entering, we were surprised at the amount of displays, food vendors, merchant tents and bathrooms there were. The food was excellent, a little expensive (expected at events like these), but the variety was outstanding. Worth the cost. The displays were stunning and huge, which you could not do at the Convention center. The price of tickets will continue to be prohibitive to those who may love to come, but cannot afford to bring the family. The music was great and the seating available for those of us ""older"" is fantastic. At the other location, at the Convention center, the seating was terrible  and made it difficult for many of the patrons that could afford the ticket price. We ABSOLUTELY love the new outside venue and hope that it will continue to be at FDR park for the foreseeable future. GREAT JOB PHS AND CITY OF PHILADELPHIA. Oh, please visit the museum on the premises. Always good to know history of others. We intend to visit each year and become a PHS (Philadelphia Horticultural society) member.  Please visit the Butterfly tent. AWESOME. ü¶ã

There are Trails where the golf course use to be,  tennis courts,  summer activities,  Asian market on Saturday,  local people BBQing can get crazy busy during those summer months but the mornings are quiet, fun to walk, ride your bike or listen to the birds chirping.
Fun place to check out especially if you're a tourist and want to enjoy an old south Philly local spot..

I liked the idea that it was outside but I guess I was expecting more flowers or at least more exotic flowers.  The fact that it was outside and hot might have played a role in that though.  The displays that were there were very nice.  Probably the only thing we didn't like was the ""carnival type sales people"" as we walked past certain vendor tents.  We paid to come to the flower show and enjoy the view, not to be hackled with a sales pitch.  There was plenty of parking within a short walk and there were also shuttles running.  As for the park itself, it seemed nice but hard to really tell with all the displays and additional people.  It looks like a nice place to take a stroll or do a picnic.",4

When we arrived another party had set up and we had tell them that we had reserved the spot and had our confirmation email. They packed up 3 tables of food with racks and left without incident and we gave them the reservation info. Several other people tried to use our picnic tables as we setup decorations near the street, before our guests arrived to sit at the picnic tables. We told them that we had reserved the area and they left. The reserved areas should be marked and cordoned off, so that people know the area is taken and limits are known. People think first come, first served, and everyone is not going to exit after setting up an area because they had no reservations. FDR has no on-site security or patrols other than the vehicles that go thru to keep the bike lanes clear. Measures should be taken immediately to address and prevent the potential for an altercation. We consider ourselves fortunate that we had no incidents. God-Blessed our celebration.",3

When I was a young kid I went fishing there all of the time and I would catch so many fish it was awesome. Even 15-20 years ago it was still good fishing. I am 43 years old and I have been fishing here since I was 8 years old and I would never thought it would get this bad. Right now they are cleaning the grounds and cutting trees and grass, but they are not doing anything for the water or fish.  And the only reason they are cleaning it up right now is because the flower show is going to be held at the park. I wish that the parks and recreation would clean out the water and restock the lakes with fish. They restock rivers and streams with trout and salmon, and huge lakes like walinpawpack lake with large mouth bass. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP US PLEASE!!

There are red fox in the area if lucky enough to see. Peaceful and quiet. In the summer there is an asian community market that sells street bbq, food and drinks.

So we took a ride to Franklin D.R. Park. We had our pizza under the pavilion, next to their inactive five place.

If you decide to use the fire place, be prepared to clean it up first.
It's definitely functional and ideal.

We love it! After we devour our pizza!
We hit the swing set, rain had stopped. We enjoyed the remaining of the day.

Worked out, really well. Thank YOU JESUS!!!!!!!",5

The trees around the pond could be pruned to about 10 feet up for the same reason.  The skate park is a shambles.  There is not a hot dog, lemonade stand, or any concession  to be found anywhere.

However, the roads are full of potholes and the bathroom facilities are extremely limited. Forget coming to this park during a baseball/football game since they allow stadium staff to charge $30 for people to park their cars, which turns the park into a huge parking lot. We pay taxes to keep the park running and aren't allowed to come and enjoy it on the weekends. I would rather pay for a private gym membership 1000 times over than spend my time swerving around avoiding potholes, checking the bulletin boards to make sure the courts aren't being booked for leagues, being charged $30 every time there is a home game, and finding out that the bathrooms doors are locked half of the time.

I am pretty sure they stock the lakes. However, sometimes there is shady people down here. Scenery is great here. They put all of the money on the baseball fields, but not what needs it more (roads, damage repairs, etc...). I hope all of these problems get addressed. I really do love this area, but it obviously needs a re-do/fix. Most‚Äôve the times, its nice here though. But, if you come down here on Eagles Football Game Days, the parking is horrible. The parking managers that do the event parking stuff are ignorant. Overall, I love this park, but it needs a renovation done as soon as possible. I will continue to come here, but yeah.",3

The skater was still very aggressive and rude and proceeded to tell me that i am not welcome here.  As I walked off of the skate area several other skaters began yelling and saying you are not welcome here.  I was in complete shock that this happened since i look at skate boarding as an art just like photography and my admiration for skate boarding community.

05/29/2018 15:18:18,Joe Lanni,106331037474841755677,"I give FDR Park, better known locally as ""The Lakes"", 3 stars because it's gotten cleaner and nicer over the last several years, but still has quite a ways to go to actually be as good as it could be. With a revitalization plan in the works, it's supposedly getting a face-lift.
The park as it is, still has A LOT to offer within its roughly 350 acres. There is a circular road/path that runs all the way around the park, great for jogging or bike riding. There are also several paved trail paths that crisscross through the middle of the park with some fairly secluded benches, good spots for viewing some of the local wildlife. There is a complex of 10 tennis courts, maybe a decade old that are very well maintained and in great shape, with a playground and a pair of baseball fields near the Broad and Pattison entrance. As you continue around the road to the first public parking area theres a picnic area across from the playground, and a large stone gazebo which over looks the lake. Over the first bridge is a large stone pavillion (originally a ""boat house"") built right on the water. The pavillion also has a floating dock, accessed from either side of the pavillion, and between April and October you can rent bikes, paddle boats and kayaks here. More public parking, and the American Swedish Historical Museum are just across the road from the pavillion. At this point the road forks, the right fork takes you to the golf course club house, pro-shop, and parking. The golf course is a public, city run course with a moderately difficult 18 holes, a driving range, chipping and putting greens (pro tip...it can get a little swampy out there if the weather has been recently wet). This fork also leads to the second entrance/exit at 20th and Pattison. The left fork continues around the park past another picnic area, over another bridge, with another parking area across the lake from the pavillion. Before you get to the highway which borders the south end of the park to the right are the original tennis courts (also newly renovated), and across from the highway are the Richie Ashburn baseball fields. Basically the whole space underneath the highway can be utilized as parking, until you get to the fairly world famous FDR Skate Park. Which is a great place for skateboarding with some great bowls and ramps, a half pipe, graffiti...the works...all integrated into the space beneath I-95. Some park buildings used for park maintenance which I believe still house bathrooms (and what used to be a snack bar at one point long ago), another picnic area and a treacherous steep exit onto broad street and another parking lot are next on the loop. At this point theres a stretch of green space before you get back to the front courts at broad and pattison.
Overall FDR park offers a lot of green space and amenities, plenty of trees and wildlife, and a great place to visit on a summer day. There are lots of hidden gems along the paths and quiet places to sit and relax or run around and play.
A couple things to note. As big and green as it is, it's a city park...there will be some trash. Also the park is basically closed to vehicles during games, unless you want to pay the $20, because it is used for tailgating...and believe me they dont care about your sob story or that you're not going to the game.",3

05/25/2018 12:40:13,Plucky Quackers,108032261925226748911,"I have been coming to this park since I was a child. It is a peaceful place where jogger go and people enjoy the view. It has picnic areas for families and a few baseball fields scattered throughout. It also has tennis courts and a child's play area. Many people bring their children to feed the various birds that congregate there. You can find ducks, geese, and swans to feed to name a few.
There is also many beautiful flowers that grow throughout the park. Great for taking pictures.
There is also the Swedish museum to visit if you like history. When I was a child it was abandoned, an empty shell of a building with 2 large canons on either side of it. Now it is repaired and open to the public.
I don't give 5 stars because there is trash that is left behind from picnicers and it gets into the lake and other areas of the landscape that takes away from its beauty.",4

Occasional amazing wildlife spotting including an occasional bald eagle, deer, woodchuck, and rare water birds. Weekends term with families with people tailgating Eagles games or picnicking and boat and Surrey rides. You can avoid this activity by going 8am.

When i got there, they told me i was not allowed in because the park was being used only for people to pay $35 and park to go to the Eagles game. I thought this was a PUBLIC park that anyone could go to, but i guess that's only when the city doesn't need a quick way to make money. This isn't the first time i was told i wasn't allowed in either. I would like to know where all this money is going. I guess the Eagles are more important than breast cancer! This just shows how F'd up this city is!",1

Not sure if it was from the new traffic patterns or not (hopefully not a permanent one) but the gate just up from where we park (off Broad St. and near the I95 off ramp) along with the gate closest to Broad on Pattison were locked at the end of the game, leaving only the gate near the golf course as the only means to exit.  We attempted to leave just after the game had ended and sat in bumper to bumper traffic for one hour and 20 minutes!  Normally we are out and crossing onto the Platt Bridge within 10-20 minutes.  I will also point out there was no police or any kind of traffic control at the light next to the golf course at the exit of FDR.

Please tell me that these gates will not be locked for every game as I cringe at the thought of having to take 1.5 hours to just get out of the lot and onto 95.  For the $35 we pay to have to park in a city park, we would hope that the Eagles and the City of Philadelphia would take a 2nd look at only allowing one of the three gates to be opened to allow the thousands of cars parked in FDR park on game day to exit the lot in a more expeditious manner.

I look forward to hearing back please.",1
